          We can all be caught out by unplanned events and surprise bills. Our new ‘Unexpected Costs’ report reveals that seven out of ten households in the UK have experienced at least one unplanned expense in the past 12 months. It also shows that one in three people have no savings or investments to help them pay for out of the blue costs.

          By cutting back and saving more you can be better prepared for the unanticipated. Once you set a goal and start saving, you can watch your money grow. Did you realise saving just &pound;3 a day adds up to &pound;1,095 over a year?
