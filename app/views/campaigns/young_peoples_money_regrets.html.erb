        Are you leaving school or heading to college? Perhaps you’re starting full-time work for the first time?
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever your position, there will be some difficult money decisions to make. You’ll maybe move away from home and stop relying on your parents for money. But with independence comes responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        You could have rent and bills to pay. Maybe you might buy a car, with all the associated running costs. And although it’s generally easy to get a credit card, it’s an easy way to slip into debt.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s a very real chance that you could make the wrong decisions – decisions that could impact on your finances for years. But we have tools and advice that can help.
