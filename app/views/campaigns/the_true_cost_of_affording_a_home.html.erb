        <p>
          From 26 April 2014, mortgage rules are about to get a lot tougher. Lenders will have to thoroughly examine your finances to be sure you can really afford the true cost of your home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our research shows three in four first-time buyers overstretch their budgets to get on the housing ladder. What’s more, not adding up the true costs of their home caused financial difficulties for one in five.
        </p>
        <p>
          The changes are designed to make sure borrowers don’t overstretch themselves and fall into debt. They mean you’ll have to present more evidence than ever before of your income and outgoings before you can get a mortgage.
