        credit or refused a loan - What you can do","description":"If you\u2019ve
        been turned down for credit find out what steps you can take to find out why","body":"<p
        class=\"intro\"><img src=\"/images/what-to-do-if-you-have-been-refused-a-loan-or-credit-card.jpg\"/>If
        you\u2019ve been turned down for a credit card or loan there are steps you
        can take to understand why. There are also things you should avoid doing which
        could make it even harder for you to get credit in the future. Read on to
        find out more and to learn about alternative borrowing options to consider
        or avoid. </p><h2>What you should be told if you have been refused credit
        or a loan </h2><p>If you\u2019re turned down for a loan or credit card, the
        credit card or loan company should tell you whether you were turned down as
        a result of a search on your credit file and, if so, which credit reference
        agency they used. You can ask for more information about why you were refused
        but they don\u2019t have to give you a detailed reply. However mistakes can
        happen\u00a0and if you do spot a mistake, write to the credit reference agency
        and ask for it to be corrected immediately. Make sure you include an explanation
        about why it''s wrong, and include any evidence you have. The agency has 28
        days to act, and the relevant detail in your credit report will be marked
        as ''disputed'' while it is investigated. </p><h2>Don\u2019t keep applying
        </h2><p>You might ask ''why have I been refused credit?''. If you have been
        refused a loan or turned down for a credit card, the worst thing you can do
        is to keep applying for more credit because any credit applications you make
        \u2013 whether or not you\u2019ve been successful \u2013 will show up on your
        credit file. Several applications in a short space of time may make lenders
        think you are desperate for cash and this will damage your credit rating further.
        Your credit rating affects whether you can get credit, how much you can borrow
        and \u2013 sometimes \u2013 the interest rate you may be charged. </p><h2>What
        to do next </h2><p>What to do next depends on why you are looking for credit.
        </p><h3>If you need to borrow to pay off other debts </h3><p>If you\u2019re
        looking to borrow in order to pay off other debts or to help you pay bills
        and living expenses at the end of the month then it\u2019s worth talking to
        a free debt adviser as soon as you can. They will be able to help you come
        up with a plan and avoid getting deeper into debt. Follow the link below for

        money at an affordable interest rate, find out if there is a credit union
        near you. Credit unions are non-profit organisations that have been set up
        to help people in their local communities. There\u2019s a cap on the amount
        of interest they can charge on their loans of 2% a month or 26.8% a year APR
        and there are no hidden charges or penalties if you repay the loan early.
        With some credit unions, you have to save for a period before you''re allowed
        to borrow. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><a href=\"/en/articles/credit-unions\">Read

        credit, also known as doorstep lending, is when a salesperson lends you money
