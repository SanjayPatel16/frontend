        more important than how much you put away \u2013 you will be surprised how
        quickly a few pounds each month builds up! </p></div><p>The easiest way to
        get your savings working for you is to set things up so that you automatically
        add a little bit each month to your savings. That way you won\u2019t have
        to remember to make the payment and you won\u2019t be tempted to skip a month.
        Before you know it, you\u2019ll have built up a solid chunk of savings for
        example, one way of saving tax efficiently is through a Cash ISA. </p><p>One
        of the quickest way to do this is to set up a standing order (a regular payment)
        from a bank current account into your chosen savings account. </p><p><div

        it on pay day </h2><p>The best time to put a bit of money aside is just after
        you\u2019ve been paid, so set up your standing order to go out on, or just
        after pay day. </p><p>Or ask your workplace if they have a savings scheme
        \u2013 and think about joining it if they do. This makes saving even easier,
        because the money comes straight out of your pay, just like your tax and National
        Insurance contributions. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><a href=\"/en/articles/workplace-investment-schemes\">More

        savings build up, they\u2019ll grow faster\u2013 even if you\u2019re only
        paying in the same regular amount. This is because each time the interest
        earned on your money is paid into your account it starts earning interest
        too. </p><p>This interest-on-interest is called compound interest, and over
        the longer term it makes a big difference to how much your savings are worth.
        </p><h2>How much can you afford to save? </h2><p>If you\u2019ve got money
        left over at the end of each week or month then great - you\u2019ve already
        got your starting point. You\u2019ll be able to save this amount \u2013 and
        maybe even more. </p><p>But even if there\u2019s usually nothing left, it
        doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t save \u2013 it\u2019s not easy to change
        how much money you have coming in but most people <strong>can </strong>change
        how much goes out. To get tips on how to cut back and <strong>unlock your

        /></div></form> </div></p><h2>What about regular investing? </h2><p>The UK
        government defines saving as putting money aside without risk, and usually
        with the chance to earn interest. Investing involves committing money into
        an investment vehicle in the hopes of making a financial gain. Investing is
        different from saving because it involves a greater level of risk and there
        is no guarantee that you will get your money back. </p><p>You can make regular
        payments from as little as \u00a325 a month into investment products, such
        as a Stocks and Shares ISA or Unit Trust Investment Funds. Investment products
        are for the longer term and are really only suitable if you already have enough
        cash savings to keep you going for 3-6 months if needs be. Investments generally
        outperform cash savings over the longer term, but their value can rise and
        fall, so you have to be prepared to take on some risk. They may be suitable
        for people who don\u2019t require easy access to their money and are prepared
        to take on some risk. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><a href=\"/en/articles/should-i-save-or-invest\">Should
