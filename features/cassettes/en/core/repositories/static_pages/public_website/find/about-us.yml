        elsewhere. </p><p>Instilling good money management habits at an early age
        is particularly important. Our work with young people is focussed on how best
        to support parents of young children, and on meeting the needs of young adults
        as they begin to make financial decisions for themselves. </p><p>We are currently
        leading the development of a UK strategy for financial capability which will
        inform and coordinate the activities of the many organisations who share an
        interest in improving people\u2019s financial well-being. </p><p>For further
