        history, such as if you\u2019ve defaulted on a loan or any late payments.
        Companies use this information to help them decide whether to allow you to
        open an account or offer you credit, and on what terms. </p><p>If you take
        a credit report out you can expect to see your credit history over the last

        Equifax and Experian. These agencies won\u2019t record some sensitive information
