        a small electric city car to avoid paying tax - there\u2019s more choice than

        a car is. It is based on how many grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) it emits per
        kilometre driven. </p><p>There are 13 tax bands with costs ranging from \u00a30

        Tiptronic S (includes \u00a35,000 government plug-in car grant) qualifies
        for \u00a30 car tax. </p><p>The big 4x4 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV 2.0 GX3h

        rate? </h2><p>The amount that a vehicle depreciates varies depending on the
        make, model, year, type and other factors associated with the car. </p><p>If
        you are looking to retain as much value as you can for your new car, there
        are some tips that will influence the rate of depreciation for your vehicle.<strong><br/>Mileage</strong>
        \u2013 the average mileage is around 10,000 per year. The more miles, the
        less your car is worth. </p><p><strong>Reliability</strong> \u2013 some cars
        have a reputation for unreliability. This can be based on <a title=\"The most
        reliable cars to own\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/the-most-reliable-cars-to-own\">customer
        satisfaction surveys</a></p><p><strong>Number of owners</strong> \u2013 the
        fewer the better. So check the number of previous owners on the car\u2019s
        logbook or V5C registration. </p><p><strong>General condition</strong> \u2013
        damage to the bodywork, interior and exterior will reduce value. Make sure
        you <a title=\"How to test drive and check a used car\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-test-drive-and-check-a-used-car\">inspect
        a used car </a>carefully before buying. </p><p><strong>Service history</strong>
        \u2013 the more complete this is the better. The service book should have
        stamps/receipts showing servicing in line with the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.
        </p><p><strong>Length of warranty</strong> \u2013 three years is good, but
        some manufacturers now offer as long as seven years, which is a bonus when
        selling your car. </p><p><strong>Desirability</strong> \u2013 some models
        are \u2018face-lifted\u2019 or replaced every few years, while some go on
        for 10 or more. The more recent the model, the better it will hold its value.
        </p><p><strong>Size</strong> \u2013 big luxury cars tend to depreciate more
        than smaller cars because they cost more to run and have higher bill for parts
        and maintenance. </p><p><strong>Fuel economy</strong> \u2013 the more miles
        per gallon the better for many buyers. This is one reason why diesels cars
        hold their value slightly better than petrol cars, although it\u2019s becoming
        less true as petrol car engine efficiency improves. </p><p><strong>Road Fund
        Licence (road tax) </strong>is also a consideration. Fuel guzzling cars cost
        much more to tax each year, which makes them less desirable when selling second-hand.\u00a0
        </p><h2>Tips for minimising depreciation </h2><ul><li> Do your research before
        buying a car \u2013 search the most up-to-date <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.whatcar.com/car-depreciation-calculator/\">What

        holidays doesn\u2019t have to break the bank, if you take advantage of cheap
        and free activities in your local area. </p><h3>1. Plan for playschemes </h3><p>See
        if your local authority, schools, <a title=\"Sure start centres\" target=\"_blank\"
        href=\"http://childrenscentresfinder.direct.gov.uk/childrenscentresfinder\">Sure
        Start Centres</a>, churches and community groups run any playschemes or holiday
        clubs during the summer holidays. If you receive income support, benefits
        or tax credits, your children may qualify for a discount on any charges. </p><h3>2.
        Look up your local leisure centre </h3><p>Again, low income families may qualify
        for concessions at your local leisure centre or swimming pool. Check the timetable
        for family swimming sessions, or see if your children would like to try different
        classes and sports. </p><h3>3. Locate your library </h3><p>Investigate activities
        at your local library, from story time for toddlers to craft activities, reading
        groups and even writing sessions for older children. </p><p>Most libraries
        run the <a title=\"Summer reading challenge\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://summerreadingchallenge.org.uk/\">Summer
        Reading Challenge</a>, which is completely free. It encourages children aged
        between four and eleven years old to read six books from the library during
        their summer holiday with rewards like posters, stickers and bookmarks. </p><h3>4.
        Make the most of museums and galleries </h3><p>Many museums and galleries
        offer free entrance to their main collections, and may also run special exhibitions,
        events or arts and crafts sessions for children. </p><h3>5. Have fun with
        a film </h3><p>Cinemas often offer cut-price tickets to family films during
        weekends and school holidays, if you are willing to go to a morning showing.
        </p><h3>6. Ride the railway </h3><p>If you fancy going further afield, consider
        buying a <a title=\"Family &amp; Friends railcard\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.familyandfriends-railcard.co.uk/\">Family
        &amp; Friends Railcard</a> to cut the cost of train fares. A one-year card
        costs \u00a330, but can then save you a third off adult tickets and 60% off
        children\u2019s fares. </p><h3>7. Take advantage of 2 for 1 tickets </h3><p>If
        you buy National Rail tickets, you can also get two tickets for the price
        of one on loads of child-friendly activities like zoos, aquariums, theme parks,
        theatres and exhibitions. Register at <a title=\"Days out guide\" target=\"_blank\"
        href=\"http://www.daysoutguide.co.uk/\">Days Out Guide</a>, work out where
        you would like to go, and then print out the relevant vouchers to take along.
        </p><h3>8. Save with supermarket vouchers </h3><p>If you use a supermarket
        loyalty card when you shop, check if you can exchange points or vouchers for
        days out, meals and travel. With some schemes, your points can be worth two
        or four times as much when used to pay for activities, compared to using them
        for money off your shopping. </p><h3>9. Think of the theatre </h3><p>Going
        to the theatre need not cost an arm and a leg if you look out for offers and
        discounted tickets. </p><p>For example, kids go free to top London shows during
        <a title=\"Kids week\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kidsweek.co.uk/\">Kids
        Week</a>, which actually runs for the whole of August. If you can afford an
        adult ticket, then one child under 16 goes free, and you can buy tickets for
        another two children at half price. </p><h3>10. Pack a picnic </h3><p>A picnic
        in a local park can become a fun day out in itself. Also, meals out can really
        drive up the cost of any activity, so plan ahead and take food, drinks and
        snacks whenever you head off. </p><p><em>Photo:\u00a0PA</em></p>","date":"2014-07-23T10:18:41+00:00"},{"id":"five-summer-driving-fuel-economy-tips","title":"Five
        summer driving fuel economy tips","description":"Find out how to drive your
        car more economically during the summer months","body":"<p class=\"intro\">Millions
        of cars take to the roads in the summer during the school holidays. </p><p>Packed
        with kids and luggage, they are not at their most economical so it''s more
        important than ever to squeeze as many miles as you can from your car''s fuel
        tank. </p><p><a title=\"Cheap petrol and diesel\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/choosing-between-petrol-and-diesel-power\">Shopping
        around for the cheapest petrol or diesel </a>and avoiding expensive motorway
        service stations will help, but there are other things you can try too...
        </p><h2>Air conditioning or windows? </h2><p>Air-conditioning increases fuel
        consumption, especially at low speeds. If it\u2019s a hot day, use the air
        conditioning for high speed driving, but open the windows around town. </p><h2>Adjust
        your driving style </h2><p>Read the road ahead, anticipating the actions of
        other drivers and potential hazards. The less braking and acceleration, the
        less fuel used. For instance, drive smoothly in heavy traffic, so avoid driving
        fast to catch up to the car in front, then having to brake. Broadly speaking,
        the smoother your drive, the more miles per gallon. </p><p>According to the
        AA, driving at 70mph uses up to 9% more fuel than at 60mph and up to 15% more
        than at 50mph. Cruising at 80mph can use up to 25% more fuel than at 70mph.
        For instance, driving 100 motorway miles at 70mph might cost you \u00a315
        at 70mph, but \u00a320 at 80mph. </p><p>Finally, watch and listen to your
        revs. Some drivers let the revs (revolutions per minute or RPM) run to 3,000
        per minute (petrol car) and 2,500 (diesel) before changing up a gear. It\u2019s
        more efficient to move up a gear at 2,500 (petrol) and 2,000 (diesel). Also,
        use high gears such as fifth and sixth gears sooner than later. </p><h2>Keep
        your car maintained </h2><p>Get your car serviced regularly to maintain engine
        efficiency and make sure you\u2019re using the correct engine oil (check the
        handbook). </p><p>Well maintained tyres are essential for safe and economical
        driving. Check tyres pressures regularly (especially before a motorway journey).
        The RAC claims that correctly inflated tyres can improve fuel consumption
        by up to 2% </p><h2>Stay slippery </h2><p>Broadly speaking the most aerodynamic
        cars are the most fuel efficient cars. </p><p>Wind resistance increases fuel
        consumption, so try to keep windows closed at high speeds and remove roof
        racks and boxes when not in use. Removing a roof-top cargo box can save as
        much as 20% on fuel over a year. </p><h2>Reduce weight </h2><p>Lighter cars
        use less fuel, so don\u2019t drive around with unnecessary items in your boot
        and unless you\u2019re on a long journey, consider running your fuel tank
        half full or less. </p><p>Read our full guide to <u><a title=\"Guide to buying,

        prices on different routes. Next time you book a ticket, try them out to see
        what you can save. </p><h2>1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Big savings when you
        buy in advance </h2><p>Travelling from London to Manchester between 5pm and
        6pm can be expensive. Buying your ticket on the day would cost you \u00a3160.50.
        </p><p>Buy it four weeks ahead and the same trains were \u00a3113. And if
        you can plan three months in advance, the lowest fare is \u00a335.50. </p><p><strong>So
        on this route, booking three months in advance would SAVE \u00a3125. </strong></p><h2>2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lower
        the price by going later </h2><p>Just by taking the train three hours later
        on the same London to Manchester route, you could get a ticket for \u00a378.70
        (on the day) or \u00a312.50 (three months in advance). </p><p><strong>That\u2019s
        a SAVING of \u00a381.80 on the day.</strong></p><h2>3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Split
        your ticket, stay in your seat </h2><p>It\u2019s a long journey from Birmingham
        to Plymouth, and quite expensive. But often trains are cheaper if you split
        up your journey buying two or three tickets for different stages of the journey.
        You often don\u2019t even need to change trains. </p><p>If you bought a single
        direct ticket on the day it would cost \u00a3111.90. But if you bought a ticket
        from Birmingham to Exeter, and another from Exeter to Plymouth for the very
        same train, the total would be \u00a390.60 </p><p><strong>Splitting tickets
        but not the train to Plymouth would SAVE \u00a321.30. </strong></p><h2>4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Change
        the start station, change the fare </h2><p>Travel from London to Birmingham
        normally goes from Euston to New Street and could cost \u00a382 for travel
        on the day. But if you\u2019re prepared to go from London Marylebone to Birmingham
        Moor Street, you\u2019d cut the fare by more than half to \u00a340. They\u2019re
        both central stations. </p><p><strong>\u00a342.50 SAVED for an extra 10 minutes
        trip.</strong></p><h2>5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More haste, less savings </h2><p>Take
        the stopping train from London Euston to Birmingham New Street, and it\u2019s
        just \u00a327.50. This train does take 40 minutes more than the fastest option,
        but if you\u2019re not in rush it could be worth it. </p><p><strong>Taking
        your time to get to Birmingham would SAVE as much as \u00a354.50.</strong></p><h2>6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Young?
        Old? In a couple? Save with a railcard </h2><p>Leeds to Edinburgh on the day
        could cost \u00a394.30. A valid railcard costs \u00a330 for the year and brings
        the fare down by a third to \u00a362.25. </p><p><strong>Eligible railcards
        would SAVE \u00a332.05 on this journey.</strong></p><h2>7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Check
        if two singles are cheaper </h2><p>It seems like a strange idea but sometimes
        two singles are often cheaper than a return, particularly if you\u2019re getting
        advance or off peak tickets. Travelling from Manchester to Cardiff has a standard
        off-peak return price of \u00a380. Getting two singles in a month\u2019s time
        would be \u00a334. </p><p><strong> Checking the price of singles vs a return
        would SAVE \u00a346.</strong></p><h2>8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Get on the
        right train \u2013 it\u2019s expensive to pay twice! </h2><p>There were tickets
        as cheap as \u00a36 to travel from Birmingham to London Marylebone. But they\u2019re
        for a specific train on a specific route. If you didn\u2019t realise and got
        a different train, conductors would probably make you buy a new ticket at
        full price\u2013 a staggering \u00a382. </p><p><strong>Not travelling on the
        train booked would cost you and extra \u00a382. </strong></p><h2>9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don\u2019t
        get derailed by extra fees </h2><p>Some sites will have a booking fee and
        a charge for using a credit card. Going via the train provider\u2019s own
        websites shouldn\u2019t cost you more. </p><p><strong>Fees on some of the
        routes above were as much as \u00a34, potentially more.</strong></p><h2>10)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01st
        class might be first for value </h2><p>If advance tickets are already sold
        out in standard class, you might find it cheaper to go by 1st. On an afternoon
        trip from Newcastle to Glasgow, the standard single was \u00a339.50, but 1st
        class on the same train was \u00a331.70. </p><p><strong>So, you could SAVE
        \u00a37.70 and have a comfier journey by travelling in first class on some
        journeys.</strong></p><p>Read our guide for more ways to<a title=\"Cut your

        be a waste of money if you don\u2019t have a history of losing your handset
        or your phone is cheap. That\u2019s because mobile phone cover can cost anything
        from \u00a316 to \u00a3300 a year. </p><p>However, it may be worth considering
        if you have an expensive phone or are locked into a long-term contract. If
        you couldn''t afford to replace your phone without insuring it, consider starting
        to save to replace it. </p><p>Also your phone could be included in your home
        insurance policy. There is usually no point in doubling up on insurance (as
        you could only draw on one policy for an individual claim). </p><p>On the
        other hand, the high excesses on home insurance \u2013 you typically have
        to pay the first \u00a350 to \u00a3100 of a claim \u2013 and the damage to
        your no claims bonus could make mobile phone insurance worthwhile. If you
        can\u2019t live without your phone, look at how quickly your home insurer
        will replace it as they may be slower. </p><p>If you are unsure, see our guide

        warranties</a> cover repair costs, usually on white goods, after the retailer\u2019s
        guarantee lapses. They typically last for between one and five years depending
        on the purchase price of the item being protected, and they are expensive.
        </p><p>For example, a five-year extended warranty on a \u00a3449 TV could
        cost nearly \u00a3150. But as a consumer you have rights to protect you against
        faulty purchases. </p><p>If the goods you bought are faulty, you\u2019re covered
        by the 1979 Sale of Goods Act. This says that goods sold should be of satisfactory
        quality, fit for purpose and last for a reasonable time. If they are not,
        you can return them and ask for a refund or replacement. </p><p>Provided the
        cause isn\u2019t reasonable wear and tear, you are within your rights to return
        goods up to six years after you bought them. </p><h2>ID theft insurance </h2><p>ID
        theft insurance can cost around \u00a310 a year. This may seem a small sum
        for peace of mind. </p><p>But you are already covered for any financial loss
        if your identity is used fraudulently by your bank or credit card provider.
        For a claim to be rejected your provider must prove you were grossly negligent
        or committed fraud. </p><p>The provider can withhold the first \u00a350 of
        any loss, but they invariably waive this \u2013 so you shouldn\u2019t be left
        out of pocket. </p><p>It\u2019s also worth noting that Visit our <a title=\"ID

        Money Advice Service estimates that some store cards charge twice as much
        interest as credit cards. So, a 10% sign-up discount could cost you more in

        Some will reject claims where the alarm is not set up to cover unoccupied
        rooms when you\u2019re asleep. They can do this if the policy states the alarm
        must be activated in these circumstances. </p><h2>Low flying planes </h2><p>Many

        insurance</a> and car insurance\u00a0will exclude damage caused by sonic booms
        from low flying aircraft. These are pressure waves from aircraft travelling
        at or above the speed of sound. </p><p>Although Concorde is no longer flying,
        military aircraft do crisscross the skies in some areas of the country, so
        this could be an issue if you live in the vicinity of an RAF base or under
        a regularly-used flight path. </p><h2>Falling coconuts </h2><p>If you\u2019re
        travelling to a tropical destination and hire a car, be careful where you
        park. Many standard <a title=\"Car insurance when driving abroad\" target=\"_blank\"
        href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/car-insurance-when-driving-abroad\">car
        hire policies</a> will exclude damage caused by falling coconuts. If this
        sounds strange, remember that coconuts grow in abundance in the Caribbean,
        Cook Islands and Polynesia among other places and it\u2019s tempting to park
        in the shade of a coconut tree.\u00a0 </p><p>Check your policy (when you pick
        up your car at the local depot) and upgrade to one that will protect against
        this surprisingly common cause of claims. </p><h2>What you can do </h2><p>Some
        of these exclusions are so unlikely that it\u2019s probably not worth worrying
        about, as is the case with nuclear explosions or invasions, and in any event
        you\u2019d probably struggle to get insured for anywhere near a reasonable
        sum. </p><p>Others are worth scrutinising the small print for and either shopping
        around or asking your insurance for an upgrade, as could be the case if you\u2019re
        visiting coconut territory. </p><p>In any event, always read policy terms
        and conditions before signing on the dotted line, and speak to the insurer
        if you have a query. </p><p><em>Photo: PA</em></p>","date":"2014-07-18T09:29:21+00:00"},{"id":"can-you-afford-a-mortgage-try-our-new-calculator","title":"Can
        you afford a mortgage? Try our new calculator","description":"Just having
        enough for the deposit to buy a home is no longer enough. Now you need to
        think about other costs too.","body":"<p class=\"intro\">Taking out a mortgage,
        whether to buy your first home or simply to remortgage, became more difficult
        in April this year when new rules changed how lenders decide how much they
        will loan you. </p><p>The rules, called the Mortgage Market Review (MMR),
        mean that it\u2019s not only your income that is taken into account. Now they\u2019ll
        look closely at your outgoings too and how you spend. If you\u2019re buying
        with a partner, their finances will also be examined. They\u2019ll look at
        how you would cope with a rise in interest rates and take into account changes
        in your lifestyle, such as whether you are likely to retire or have children.
        </p><p>The result could be that you may not get the amount you need to buy
        the home you want. </p><p>We\u2019ve developed a tool to help you get an idea
        of how your finances affect your mortgage application. The <a title=\"Mortgage
        affordability calculator\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/house-buying/mortgage-affordability-calculator\">Mortgage
        affordability calculator</a>\u00a0will estimate how much you can afford to
        borrow to buy a home. </p><p>This calculator is a guide as lenders will all
        have different affordability criteria when deciding how much to lend to you.
        A mortgage interview can take around 1.5 hours and this calculator will help
        you prepare. </p><h2>How the calculator works\u00a0 </h2><p>To complete the
        tool you\u2019ll need need information on income, take home pay, estimates
        on loans and credit payments, food and groceries, bills, insurance, child
        care, etc. </p><p>If you are buying with someone else, please include this
        information for them. </p><p>The tool will also give you an idea of whether
        you could manage with the mortgage repayments easily or whether you may be
        overstretched. If your potential mortgage repayments are high as a percentage
        of your income and outgoings, you run a high risk of overstretching your budget
        to meet them, especially if interest rates rise. There are also links to our
        guides to help you find an affordable mortgage. </p><p>Use our <a title=\"Mortgage
