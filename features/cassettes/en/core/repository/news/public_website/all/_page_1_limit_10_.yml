        there are numerous financial products that might seem good on first viewing
        but are less appealing when you dig a little deeper. Here\u2019s a selection
        of goods you might want to avoid, unless you are sure you\u2019ll enjoy the
        benefits. </p><h2>Mobile phone insurance </h2><p>Mobile phone insurance could
        be a waste of money if you don\u2019t have a history of losing your handset
        or your phone is cheap. That\u2019s because mobile phone cover can cost anything
        from \u00a316 to \u00a3300 a year. </p><p>However, it may be worth considering
        if you have an expensive phone or are locked into a long-term contract. If
        you couldn''t afford to replace your phone without insuring it, consider starting
        to save to replace it. </p><p>Also your phone could be included in your home
        insurance policy. There is usually no point in doubling up on insurance (as
        you could only draw on one policy for an individual claim). </p><p>On the
        other hand, the high excesses on home insurance \u2013 you typically have
        to pay the first \u00a350 to \u00a3100 of a claim \u2013 and the damage to
        your no claims bonus could make mobile phone insurance worthwhile. If you
        can\u2019t live without your phone, look at how quickly your home insurer
        will replace it as they may be slower. </p><p>If you are unsure, see our guide

        title=\"Extended warranties\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/extended-warranties-are-they-worth-it\">Extended
        warranties</a> cover repair costs, usually on white goods, after the retailer\u2019s
        guarantee lapses. They typically last for between one and five years depending
        on the purchase price of the item being protected, and they are expensive.
        </p><p>For example, a five-year extended warranty on a \u00a3449 TV could
        cost nearly \u00a3150. But as a consumer you have rights to protect you against
        faulty purchases. </p><p>If the goods you bought are faulty, you\u2019re covered
        by the 1979 Sale of Goods Act. This says that goods sold should be of satisfactory
        quality, fit for purpose and last for a reasonable time. If they are not,
        you can return them and ask for a refund or replacement. </p><p>Provided the
        cause isn\u2019t reasonable wear and tear, you are within your rights to return
        goods up to six years after you bought them. </p><h2>ID theft insurance </h2><p>ID
        theft insurance can cost around \u00a310 a year. This may seem a small sum
        for peace of mind. </p><p>But you are already covered for any financial loss
        if your identity is used fraudulently by your bank or credit card provider.
        For a claim to be rejected your provider must prove you were grossly negligent
        or committed fraud. </p><p>The provider can withhold the first \u00a350 of
        any loss, but they invariably waive this \u2013 so you shouldn\u2019t be left
        out of pocket. </p><p>It\u2019s also worth noting that Visit our <a title=\"ID

        out a <a title=\"Store cards explained\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/store-cards-explained\">store
        card</a>. These are credit cards branded to specific shops, and offer incentives
        such as a discount off your initial purchase, freebees and exclusive offers.
        </p><p>As long as they don\u2019t tempt you to overspend and you pay your
        bill off in full on time, they\u2019re fine. However, you will pay very high
        interest rates if you don\u2019t clear your balance each month. </p><p>The
        Money Advice Service estimates that some store cards charge twice as much
        interest as credit cards. So, a 10% sign-up discount could cost you more in
        the long run. </p><h2>Packaged bank accounts </h2><p>You can pay around \u00a315
        a month for a <a title=\"Packaged accounts\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/packaged-accounts\">packaged
        account</a>, which provides a range of extra features, such as free travel
        insurance, mobile phone cover or better exchange rates. </p><p>However, if
        you don\u2019t expect to use these benefits, it\u2019s an expensive option.
        If you do want some of these extras, you may be able to buy them cheaper separately.
        </p><p>You also need to check the terms and conditions for exclusions and
        excesses. For instance, many accounts won\u2019t cover you under their travel
        insurance element if you are over 70 or 75. </p>","date":"2014-07-18T09:29:58+00:00"},{"id":"from-civil-war-to-sonic-booms-unexpected-insurance-exclusions-explained","title":"From

        expect a claim to be turned down if your car isn\u2019t taxed, but what about
        if your car is damaged by a falling coconut? </p><p>There is a reason why
        insurance policy documents never appear on the bestseller lists. They are
        frequently long and very dry. However, it\u2019s worth taking time to understand
        what is and isn\u2019t included, especially when compared with the considerable
        hassle of having to make a claim that gets turned down at a later stage.\u00a0
        </p><h2>Quirky insurance clauses </h2><p>Some surprising exclusions are industry
        wide, others feature on only some policies. Here are some of the more unexpected
        exclusions we found in insurance policies: </p><h2>Within arms\u2019 length
        </h2><p>You\u2019d think one of the main points of having a <a title=\"Do
        you need mobile phone insurance?\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/do-you-need-mobile-phone-insurance\">policy
        covering mobile phones</a> would be to protect against theft when you\u2019re
        out and about. But, if you knowingly leave your mobile out of reach at any
        time you\u2019re likely to have any claim for theft rejected. </p><h2>Airmiles
        and timeshare problems </h2><p>Some <a title=\"Good travel insurance policies\"
        target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/a-good-travel-insurance-policy\">travel
        policy</a> providers will not cover you for unused trips or accommodation
        booked using airline mileage or similar reward schemes.\u00a0 Some will pay
        up if you can prove the schemes have a specific monetary value. Likewise,
        some insurers will turn down claims relating to timeshare fees, such as management,
        maintenance and exchange costs.\u00a0 </p><h2>Valet parking </h2><p>Recent
        research reveals around half of <a title=\"Car insurance - choose the right
        level of cover\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/car-insurance-choose-the-right-level-of-cover\">car
        insurance policies</a> won\u2019t pay up if you hand your car keys to a valet
        parking service and it\u2019s subsequently damaged. This includes parking
        services at airports and hotels. </p><h2>Burglar alarms </h2><p>Many home
        <a title=\"Contents insurance\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/contents-insurance-get-the-right-policy-and-cover\">contents
        insurance</a> policies won\u2019t pay a burglary-related claim if you tell
        your insurer you have an alarm, but don\u2019t use it when away from home.
        Some will reject claims where the alarm is not set up to cover unoccupied
        rooms when you\u2019re asleep. They can do this if the policy states the alarm
        must be activated in these circumstances. </p><h2>Low flying planes </h2><p>Many
        home <a title=\"Buildings insurance\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/buildings-insurance-what-does-a-good-policy-look-like\">buildings
        insurance</a> and car insurance\u00a0will exclude damage caused by sonic booms
        from low flying aircraft. These are pressure waves from aircraft travelling
        at or above the speed of sound. </p><p>Although Concorde is no longer flying,
        military aircraft do crisscross the skies in some areas of the country, so
        this could be an issue if you live in the vicinity of an RAF base or under
        a regularly-used flight path. </p><h2>Falling coconuts </h2><p>If you\u2019re
        travelling to a tropical destination and hire a car, be careful where you
        park. Many standard <a title=\"Car insurance when driving abroad\" target=\"_blank\"
        href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/car-insurance-when-driving-abroad\">car
        hire policies</a> will exclude damage caused by falling coconuts. If this
        sounds strange, remember that coconuts grow in abundance in the Caribbean,
        Cook Islands and Polynesia among other places and it\u2019s tempting to park
        in the shade of a coconut tree.\u00a0 </p><p>Check your policy (when you pick
        up your car at the local depot) and upgrade to one that will protect against
        this surprisingly common cause of claims. </p><h2>What you can do </h2><p>Some
        of these exclusions are so unlikely that it\u2019s probably not worth worrying
        about, as is the case with nuclear explosions or invasions, and in any event
        you\u2019d probably struggle to get insured for anywhere near a reasonable
        sum. </p><p>Others are worth scrutinising the small print for and either shopping
        around or asking your insurance for an upgrade, as could be the case if you\u2019re
        visiting coconut territory. </p><p>In any event, always read policy terms
        and conditions before signing on the dotted line, and speak to the insurer
        if you have a query. </p><p><em>Photo: PA</em></p>","date":"2014-07-18T09:29:21+00:00"},{"id":"can-you-afford-a-mortgage-try-our-new-calculator","title":"Can

        mean that it\u2019s not only your income that is taken into account. Now they\u2019ll
        look closely at your outgoings too and how you spend. If you\u2019re buying
        with a partner, their finances will also be examined. They\u2019ll look at

        overstretched. If your potential mortgage repayments are high as a percentage
        of your income and outgoings, you run a high risk of overstretching your budget

        Tiptronic S (includes \u00a35,000 government plug-in car grant) qualifies

        Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), who regulate the financial services in
        the UK, have proposed the caps and will now consult on the suggestions. The
        new rules could come into effect in January 2015. The FCA estimate that it
        would save consumers an average of \u00a3193 a year. </p><p>Until any changes
        take place, if you\u2019re considering a payday loan, or are having trouble
        paying back an existing one, make sure you understand how they work and whether
        you have other options. </p><p>Some people who get a payday loan are able

        alternatives available to you. </p><p><strong>How They Work</strong></p><p>Payday
        loans are designed to give people some extra cash to tide them over for a
        short time until they get paid. Interest rates are very high which can cause
        problems if you miss your repayment deadline. Only get one if you are 100%
        sure you can pay it back on time and in full. </p><p>You\u2019re no longer

        alternatives</strong></p><p>Though they might seem easy, payday loans shouldn\u2019t
        be your first thought. Look to see if there are other ways to get money that
        won\u2019t cost you as much. </p><p>For example, if you\u2019re struggling
        to pay bills such as gas or electricity, you could find that you can arrange
        a payment plan with them. </p><p>Or you might be able to get a 0% interest
        credit card for a big purchase, which you could pay off before the interest

        ways to pay for your new car","description":"Your options for financing a
        new set of wheels","body":"<p class=\"intro\"> New car sales in the UK are
        rising and the new \u201c14\u201d registration plates are just released, so
        plenty of drivers are finding ways to afford a new set of wheels. </p><p>And
        there are a range of payment options, from buying outright to taking out finance.
        </p><p>But before taking the plunge, it''s important to make sure you understand
        exactly what''s involved before splashing out on what will probably be the
        most expensive thing you''ll buy after your home.\u00a0 </p><p>Here are five
        ways to afford your new car: </p><h2> 1. Using cash or savings </h2><p>The
        reality is few people can afford to buy a new car without needing to borrow
        money for some or all of the cost, although using savings is the cheapest
        way to finance a car purchase. </p><p>If you don\u2019t have enough savings
        to buy the car outright, you could use them to give you the biggest deposit
        possible. </p><p>Even if you use money from your savings, you may be better
        off buying the car on your credit card (although you should pay the bill off
        in full the next month) so you benefit from credit card purchase protection.
        </p><h2>2. Personal loan </h2><p>You can get a personal loan from a bank,
        building society or finance provider, and these are usually the cheapest way
        to finance a car (so long as your credit rating is good). </p><p>Make sure
        the loan is not secured against your home, otherwise you will be putting your
        home at risk if you failed to keep up with repayments. </p><p>Shop around
        for the best interest rate by comparing the APR (or annual percentage rate,
        which includes charges you have to pay as well as the interest). </p><h2>
        3. Hire purchase </h2><p>Hire purchase is a form of finance and is paid in
        installments spread over 12-60 months and you usually (but not always) have
        to put down a 10% deposit. </p><p>They are arranged by the car dealer and
        are often very competitive for new cars (less so for used cars). The loan
        is secured against the car, so you don\u2019t own it until the last payment
        is made. </p><h2>4. Personal Contract Plan </h2><p>This type of car finance
        deal is a variation on hire purchase and tends to result in lower monthly
        payments. </p><p>Instead of paying for the car outright, you agree to pay
        the difference between its sale price and its price for resale back to the
        dealer, based on a forecast of annual mileage over the term of the agreement.
        </p><p>Payments are spread over a shorter term of 12 to 36 months. </p><h2>5.
        Personal Leasing </h2><p>You can pay the dealer a fixed monthly amount for
        the use of a car, with servicing and maintenance included, as long as the
        mileage doesn\u2019t exceed a specified limit. </p><p>At the end of the agreement,
        you hand the car back. It never belongs to you.\u00a0 </p><h2>Car financing:
        Things to watch out for\u00a0\u00a0 </h2><p>As you compare car financing,
        <strong>there are a few key things to do</strong> before making a final choice.
        </p><ul><li>Make sure you can afford the monthly payment.</li><li>Make sure
        you compare interest rates by looking at the APR (annual percentage rate),
        which includes all the charges you have to pay. Remember that a higher deposit
        will normally mean a lower interest rate.</li><li>Compare the total cost of
        borrowing, including all charges over the loan.</li><li>Think carefully before
        buying payment protection insurance (PPI) or other insurance, which can be
        expensive and may give limited cover.</li><li>Beware of early repayment or
        other charges, which kick in if you exceed the forecast mileage in personal
        contract plans (and also personal leasing).</li></ul><p><a title=\"Guide to

        money </p><p><strong>Set up a budget </strong></p><p>If you want to get on
        top of your finances, a budget is a really good way to start. It\u2019s just
        a record of money you have coming in (from things like your salary or wages
        to pensions or benefits) and money going out (such as your rent or mortgage,
        insurance and Council Tax as well as living expenses and regular and irregular
        spending). </p><p>A great way to work out your budget is with our <a title=\"Budget

        budget planner</a>. </p><p><strong>Check where your money goes </strong></p><p>Keeping
        a spending diary is an effective way of seeing exactly what you spend your
        money on. Try making a note of what you spend for at least a month (including
        even small purchases). If you can do it for even longer, you\u2019ll get a
        fuller picture of what you spend your money on. </p><p>Then look through your
        diary to see where you can cut back. </p><p>Our <a title=\"Cutback calculator\"

        things such as magazines, sandwiches at lunchtime or takeaways \u2013 can
        add up. </p><p><strong>Set a savings goal </strong></p><p>Some people find
        it hard to get motivated about saving, but it\u2019s often much easier if
        you <a title=\"Set a savings goal\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/how-to-set-a-savings-goal\">set
        a goal</a> perhaps to pay for a holiday or a deposit on a new home. That way,
        rather than thinking about the money you are setting aside each month, you
        can focus on what you will be able to do with it once you\u2019ve reached
        your target. </p><p>You might decide cutting back on one or two luxuries is
        easier when you know it can help you achieve your goal. </p><p>Photo: PA</p>","date":"2014-07-14T09:08:00+00:00"},{"id":"dont-be-caught-out-when-buying-a-used-car","title":"Don''t

        the best way to finance a car?</a></p><h2>Running costs stall personal finances
        for many motorists </h2><p>It\u2019s not just buying the car that\u2019s likely
        to end up burning a hole in your pocket. Maintenance and repairs account for
        the largest unexpected cost, with a quarter of motorists spending \u00a3421
        on average more than they expected in the first 12 months. </p><p>Fuel costs
        have been high for some time, but they still caught out more than one in four
        drivers, who spent \u00a3295 on average more than they estimated. </p><p>Unexpectedly
        large insurance premiums were a headache for 23%, with the average policy
        costing \u00a3293 more than expected. It\u2019s of little surprise that two
        in ten car owners ended up in debt as a result of their purchase. </p><h2>Depreciation
        gets forgotten </h2><p>While the vast majority of recent second-hand car buyers
        took into account the purchase cost of buying a car, as well as fuel, insurance,
        possible repairs and maintenance as well as vehicle tax, more than one in
        four gave no thought to the MOT or depreciation. </p><p>All cars older than
        three years must have an annual MOT test - apart from the cost of the test
        you may have to pay to replace worn out parts or other repairs. </p><p>All

        tear as well as other factors, but some makes and models hold their value
        better than others. </p><p>It is an important issue for drivers who intend
