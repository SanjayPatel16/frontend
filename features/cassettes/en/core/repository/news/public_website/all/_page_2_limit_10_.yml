        Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), who regulate the financial services in
        the UK, have proposed the caps and will now consult on the suggestions. The
        new rules could come into effect in January 2015. The FCA estimate that it
        would save consumers an average of \u00a3193 a year. </p><p>Until any changes

        loans are designed to give people some extra cash to tide them over for a
        short time until they get paid. Interest rates are very high which can cause
        problems if you miss your repayment deadline. Only get one if you are 100%

        alternatives</strong></p><p>Though they might seem easy, payday loans shouldn\u2019t
        be your first thought. Look to see if there are other ways to get money that
        won\u2019t cost you as much. </p><p>For example, if you\u2019re struggling
        to pay bills such as gas or electricity, you could find that you can arrange
        a payment plan with them. </p><p>Or you might be able to get a 0% interest

        ways to pay for your new car","description":"Your options for financing a
        new set of wheels","body":"<p class=\"intro\"> New car sales in the UK are
        rising and the new \u201c14\u201d registration plates are just released, so
        plenty of drivers are finding ways to afford a new set of wheels. </p><p>And
        there are a range of payment options, from buying outright to taking out finance.
        </p><p>But before taking the plunge, it''s important to make sure you understand
        exactly what''s involved before splashing out on what will probably be the
        most expensive thing you''ll buy after your home.\u00a0 </p><p>Here are five
        ways to afford your new car: </p><h2> 1. Using cash or savings </h2><p>The
        reality is few people can afford to buy a new car without needing to borrow
        money for some or all of the cost, although using savings is the cheapest
        way to finance a car purchase. </p><p>If you don\u2019t have enough savings
        to buy the car outright, you could use them to give you the biggest deposit
        possible. </p><p>Even if you use money from your savings, you may be better
        off buying the car on your credit card (although you should pay the bill off
        in full the next month) so you benefit from credit card purchase protection.
        </p><h2>2. Personal loan </h2><p>You can get a personal loan from a bank,
        building society or finance provider, and these are usually the cheapest way
        to finance a car (so long as your credit rating is good). </p><p>Make sure
        the loan is not secured against your home, otherwise you will be putting your
        home at risk if you failed to keep up with repayments. </p><p>Shop around
        for the best interest rate by comparing the APR (or annual percentage rate,
        which includes charges you have to pay as well as the interest). </p><h2>
        3. Hire purchase </h2><p>Hire purchase is a form of finance and is paid in
        installments spread over 12-60 months and you usually (but not always) have
        to put down a 10% deposit. </p><p>They are arranged by the car dealer and
        are often very competitive for new cars (less so for used cars). The loan
        is secured against the car, so you don\u2019t own it until the last payment
        is made. </p><h2>4. Personal Contract Plan </h2><p>This type of car finance
        deal is a variation on hire purchase and tends to result in lower monthly
        payments. </p><p>Instead of paying for the car outright, you agree to pay
        the difference between its sale price and its price for resale back to the
        dealer, based on a forecast of annual mileage over the term of the agreement.
        </p><p>Payments are spread over a shorter term of 12 to 36 months. </p><h2>5.
        Personal Leasing </h2><p>You can pay the dealer a fixed monthly amount for
        the use of a car, with servicing and maintenance included, as long as the
        mileage doesn\u2019t exceed a specified limit. </p><p>At the end of the agreement,
        you hand the car back. It never belongs to you.\u00a0 </p><h2>Car financing:
        Things to watch out for\u00a0\u00a0 </h2><p>As you compare car financing,
        <strong>there are a few key things to do</strong> before making a final choice.
        </p><ul><li>Make sure you can afford the monthly payment.</li><li>Make sure
        you compare interest rates by looking at the APR (annual percentage rate),
        which includes all the charges you have to pay. Remember that a higher deposit
        will normally mean a lower interest rate.</li><li>Compare the total cost of
        borrowing, including all charges over the loan.</li><li>Think carefully before
        buying payment protection insurance (PPI) or other insurance, which can be
        expensive and may give limited cover.</li><li>Beware of early repayment or
        other charges, which kick in if you exceed the forecast mileage in personal
        contract plans (and also personal leasing).</li></ul><p><a title=\"Guide to

        money </p><p><strong>Set up a budget </strong></p><p>If you want to get on
        top of your finances, a budget is a really good way to start. It\u2019s just
        a record of money you have coming in (from things like your salary or wages
        to pensions or benefits) and money going out (such as your rent or mortgage,
        insurance and Council Tax as well as living expenses and regular and irregular
        spending). </p><p>A great way to work out your budget is with our <a title=\"Budget
        planner\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/budget-planner\">online
        budget planner</a>. </p><p><strong>Check where your money goes </strong></p><p>Keeping
        a spending diary is an effective way of seeing exactly what you spend your
        money on. Try making a note of what you spend for at least a month (including
        even small purchases). If you can do it for even longer, you\u2019ll get a
        fuller picture of what you spend your money on. </p><p>Then look through your
        diary to see where you can cut back. </p><p>Our <a title=\"Cutback calculator\"
        target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/cut-back-calculator\">cut-back
        calculator</a> will quickly show you how small changes to your day-to-day
        spending can save you money in the long run. Even small amounts \u2013 for
        things such as magazines, sandwiches at lunchtime or takeaways \u2013 can
        add up. </p><p><strong>Set a savings goal </strong></p><p>Some people find
        it hard to get motivated about saving, but it\u2019s often much easier if
        you <a title=\"Set a savings goal\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/how-to-set-a-savings-goal\">set
        a goal</a> perhaps to pay for a holiday or a deposit on a new home. That way,
        rather than thinking about the money you are setting aside each month, you
        can focus on what you will be able to do with it once you\u2019ve reached
        your target. </p><p>You might decide cutting back on one or two luxuries is
        easier when you know it can help you achieve your goal. </p><p>Photo: PA</p>","date":"2014-07-14T09:08:00+00:00"},{"id":"dont-be-caught-out-when-buying-a-used-car","title":"Don''t

        on a second-hand car bought in the past two year, with the 65-plus age group

        for a car</a> for top tips on affording the car you want. </p><h2>Saving to
        buy a car </h2><p>A car may be one of the most expensive things we buy, which
        is why most drivers rely on savings to pay for them. Friends and family stumped
        up some or all of the money in 13% of cases (many of whom will have to pay
        back what they are given), while 10% opted for a car finance deal. One in
        seven either used a personal loan or paid for their car on a credit card.

        the best way to finance a car?</a></p><h2>Running costs stall personal finances
        for many motorists </h2><p>It\u2019s not just buying the car that\u2019s likely
        to end up burning a hole in your pocket. Maintenance and repairs account for
        the largest unexpected cost, with a quarter of motorists spending \u00a3421
        on average more than they expected in the first 12 months. </p><p>Fuel costs
        have been high for some time, but they still caught out more than one in four
        drivers, who spent \u00a3295 on average more than they estimated. </p><p>Unexpectedly
        large insurance premiums were a headache for 23%, with the average policy
        costing \u00a3293 more than expected. It\u2019s of little surprise that two
        in ten car owners ended up in debt as a result of their purchase. </p><h2>Depreciation
        gets forgotten </h2><p>While the vast majority of recent second-hand car buyers
        took into account the purchase cost of buying a car, as well as fuel, insurance,
        possible repairs and maintenance as well as vehicle tax, more than one in
        four gave no thought to the MOT or depreciation. </p><p>All cars older than
        three years must have an annual MOT test - apart from the cost of the test
        you may have to pay to replace worn out parts or other repairs. </p><p>All
        cars will suffer from depreciation becoming worth less to reflect wear and
        tear as well as other factors, but some makes and models hold their value
        better than others. </p><p>It is an important issue for drivers who intend
        to sell their car after a few years, and hope to recoup a decent amount of
        their initial spend. </p><p>Our <a title=\"Car costs calculator\" target=\"_blank\"
        href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/car-costs-calculator\">Car
        costs calculator</a> allows you to see the effects of depreciation on the
        value of a car, as well as typical amounts you\u2019d expect to pay for the
        vehicle, maintenance and insurance. </p><h2>More than one in four struggled
        to cover car-running costs </h2><p>While many drivers can cope with higher-than-expected
        motor-related bills, 27% said they found it hard to meet the costs of keeping
        their car on the road. Parents with children living at home and female drivers
        in particular struggled to meet the essentials. </p><p>Three in five of those
        who experienced difficulties in keeping their car on the road said they were
        forced to cut back on other things, such as treats and clothing, to pay their
        bills. Almost one in four of these motorists felt it had a big impact on household
        finance, but more worrying is that one in five got into debt or increased
        their debt in order to pay for car-running costs. </p><h2>Haggling? </h2><p>If

        the deal with a garage </h2><p>If you are negotiating with a dealer, be friendly
        and polite, but never let the salesperson know your maximum limit. </p><p>If
        you\u2019re a cash buyer, don\u2019t tell the salesperson this straight away.
        </p><p>Dealers make bigger profits on finance deals, so let them negotiate
        the car\u2019s price on that basis. You can then decline the finance deal
        later in the process. </p><p>Start off by stating an amount lower than you\u2019re
        actually prepared to pay \u2013 you can then gradually increase it if necessary.
        Try to avoid raising your price by far more than the dealer is dropping his
        price. </p><p>When you make an offer, don\u2019t speak again until the salesperson
        replies. </p><p>It also pays to be positive about your aims: for example,
        don\u2019t say <em>\u201ccan I have a discount?\u201d</em>, but instead say
        <em>\u201chow much discount can I have?\u201d</em></p><p>If you are struggling
        to get a discount but really want the car, offer to buy the car there and

        a car</a>. </p><h2>1) Have a realistic budget </h2><p>Before you do anything
        else, you must work out how much you have to spend on a car. Don\u2019t let
        your heart rule your head. </p><p>Look beyond the basic purchase price, an
        d monthly finance repayments if you''re planning to borrow, and consider running
        costs. Fuel, road tax, maintenance, breakdown cover and insurance all add
        up to give you a total cost which can be as much as \u00a33,500 a year. </p><p><a

        calculator</a> to discover how much you could start saving towards your new
        car. </p><h2>2) Choose the right car for you </h2><p>Once you''ve worked out
        your budget, it''s time to see what you can get for your money. Here there
        are more decisions to make, such as whether you''re going to buy new or used,
        and will it be petrol, diesel, hybrid or electric? </p><p>Do your research
        and find out about reliability, safety and values. Get recommendations from
        friends and family and look at car websites such as <a title=\"WhatCar?\"
        target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.whatcar.com/\">WhatCar?</a> and <a title=\"Which?
        Car\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.which.co.uk/cars/\">Which?</a> for
        advice on which cars to buy. </p><p>Also consider depreciation (the difference
        between a car\u2019s value when you buy it and when you come to sell it) and
        a car''s tax band. Broadly speaking, the lower the band the less you pay in
        road tax , insurance and fuel. </p><p>Use our <a title=\"Car costs calculator\"

        all you need is the registration number of the car you\u2019re thinking of
        buying. </p><h2>3) Buy at the right time </h2><p>Getting a good deal on a
        used car can also depend on the time of year you buy it. Make sure you take
        advantage of seasonal factors that affect the car trade. </p><p>For instance,
        March and September are the peak months for sales of new cars, often through
        part-exchange deals. So dealers will have lots of used cars to sell, which
        puts you in a strong position when negotiating. </p><p><a title=\"When to

        before handing over your hard-earned cash on a used car. </p><p>Many cars
        have hidden histories so start by carrying out a history check to discover
        who owns the car or whether it''s the subject of an outstanding finance agreement.
        It will also tell you whether it''s been an insurance write-off or has any

        other companies provide such services. </p><h2>5) Negotiate the price </h2><p>For
        many, the hardest part of the car-buying process is negotiating, or haggling,
        with the seller. Whether it''s a dealer or private seller, you''re going to
        have to shake on a deal. Read our <a title=\"How to negotiate when buying

        tips for negotiating the price of a used car</a>. </p><p>But before discussing
        the price, make sure you know your budget, you''ve researched the value of
        the car by looking at similar ones for sale on websites and in classified
        ads, or by looking at car valuation guides in magazines and websites such
        as WhatCar? and Auto Trader. </p>","date":"2014-07-09T16:42:18+00:00"},{"id":"buying-a-used-car-when-to-walk-away","title":"Buying
        a used car - when to walk away","description":"The right information will
        help you spot rogue traders.","body":"<p> Buying privately from the owner
        is generally the cheapest way to buy a used car, but it''s also the riskiest.
        </p><p>However, if you''re armed with the right information it will help you
        spot scams and rogue traders. Ultimately, if you sense something is wrong,
        simply walk away. Here\u2019s some clues to possibly dodgy practices. </p><h2>Private
        adverts </h2><p>When you phone the number advertised, always ask: \"Is the
        car still for sale?\" You should be suspicious if the reply is: \"Which one?\"
        A rogue seller may have more than one car for sale. </p><h2>Meeting place
        </h2><p>Always arrange to meet at the seller''s home. Sometimes a seller might
        suggest meeting halfway, at a motorway service station for instance, so you
        can view the car. </p><p>It may seem like a kind gesture, but beware, this
        is a common ruse used by criminals selling stolen or cloned vehicles. If you\u2019re
        buying privately, you should always view the car at the registered keeper\u2019s
        address, as detailed on the V5 (log book). </p><p>Never buy a car in a service
        station or pub car park. To find out how to test drive and check a used car
        go to our guide on <a title=\"How to test drive and check a used car\" target=\"_blank\"

        to test drive and check a used car</a>. </p><h2>Documents check </h2><p>At
        the very least, a used car should come with a V5 document (log book) and a
        valid MOT. Also check that the V5C has a watermark and there are no spelling
        mistakes or alterations. </p><p>The name and address on the V5C should match
        the seller''s (if in doubt, ask to see the seller''s driving licence) and
        check the the VIN (chassis number) on the V5C matches the VIN number on the
        car. </p><p>The VIN number can be found in various places, but it is often
        embossed on a metal plate in the engine bay or on the body of the car - sometimes
        around a door. Be suspicious if the plate looks damaged or has been tampered
        with. </p><p>The VIN should also be engraved at the base of the windscreen
        on the passenger\u2019s side. The car also must have an MOT to demonstrate
        that it''s roadworthy. A sign of a good used car is when it comes with previous
        MOT documents. It\u2019s even better if I has a service history too. </p><h2>Genuine
        mileage? </h2><p>If the car has no service history or previous MOTs it''s
        difficult to check its mileage there and then. However, there are still a
        few signs to look out for. </p><p>For instance, the mileage is low, but the
        wear and tear looks heavy or maybe the steering wheel and gear knob look newer
        than the rest of the car, suggesting they have been changed for the sale.
        Also, if the milometer is analogue (not digital), check to see if the numbers
        are out of line. </p><p>Back home, if you have the V5C registration certificate,
        number plate and MOT test number, you can check free via the <a title=\"Check
        MOT history vehicle\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/check-mot-history-vehicle\">Driver
        and Vehicle Standards Agency</a> (DVSA). </p><h2>The price is right </h2><p>If
        you''ve done your research and the asking price is so low it''s too good to
        be true, then it probably is. The car may well have a hidden history, be stolen
        or it does not belong to the person selling it. </p><p>Use our <a title=\"car

        </p><h2>Independent inspection </h2><p>Various motoring organisations, such
        as the RAC and Green Flag, carry out vehicle inspections for a fee to give
        you a little extra peace of mind. If the seller refuses to allow an independent
        inspection, then they''ve probably got something to hide. </p>","date":"2014-07-09T15:53:28+00:00"},{"id":"keep-on-running-six-ways-to-save-on-car-maintenance","title":"Keep
        on running \u2013 six ways to save on car maintenance","description":"Paying
        to maintain your car can be expensive. Find out how to cut down your maintenance
        bills.","body":"<p class=\"intro\"> One of the best ways to cut down on the
        cost of running a car is to make sure that it needs as little repair work
        as possible. </p><p>However, one in three motorists lack the basic knowledge
        to keep their car maintained, despite nearly 59% feeling such maintenance
        is essential, according to a survey for Auto Trader. </p><p>With care and
        attention, shopping around and planning, it''s possible to cut your costs.
        A 2013 survey by Trust My Garage, the national independent garage scheme,
        found that 64% of car owners have had to find up to \u00a3500 for unexpected
        car repair bills. Over a fifth had to pay more than \u00a3500, whilst 10%
        of motorists had to shell out more than \u00a31,000. </p><h2>1) Save money
        on servicing </h2><p>Big savings can be made on your car''s annual service
        by going to a local independent garage instead of main dealers. According
        to the Independent Garage Association, a visit to an independent garage costs
        \u00a340 an hour less on average than a franchise dealer. </p><p>If you''re
        trying a garage for the first time, get a quote, ask for a list with prices
        and compare prices locally. </p><p>Also consider chains such as Halfords Autocentre
        which offers full services from \u00a3134 and claims to be up to 40% less
        than main dealers when booked online. </p><p>You can find recommended garages
        at <a title=\"MotorCodes\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.motorcodes.co.uk/\">MotorCodes</a>
        and <a title=\"Trust My Garage\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.trustmygarage.co.uk/\">Trust

        tyres regularly. Running them at the right pressure not only saves fuel, but
        makes them last longer. Tyres that are over or under pressure wear unevenly
        and will need to be replaced sooner. Check the tracking regularly too as wheels
        that are out of alignment wear unevenly.</li><li>Consider ordering your tyres
        online. Some companies will fit them at your home, others have a network of
        trusted fitters.</li><li>Avoid possible nasty repair bills by keeping your
        oil, coolant and brake fluid levels topped up.</li><li>According to the AA,
        flat batteries are their most common call-out, many failing after only a few
        years because they are not fully charged. Modern batteries need the odd long
        journey to fully charge. The AA estimates 240 miles of driving with no load
        or eight hours of continuous driving. Alternatively, using a battery trickle
        charger occasionally might extend your car battery''s life.</li></ul><h2>3)
        Get a cut-price MOT </h2><p>Companies can only charge up to the official maximum
        of \u00a354.85 for an MOT but a quick search online will turn up many garages
        which will test your car for as much as half the price. You may also be able
        to get a discount using online vouchers and getting your MOT done at the same
        time as a service. </p><p>You can also get an MOT done at a local council
        test centre. They don\u2019t normally carry out repairs as well as MOTs which
        means they are impartial when inspecting your car. </p><p>For a list of local
        council MOT test centres that don\u2019t carry our repairs, visit the <a title=\"UKMOT

        savings</a></p><h2>4) Cut the cost of repairs </h2><p>Compare quotes from
        garages and ask them for an itemised list of parts and labour. You are now
        equipped with all the information you need to go to online or visit your local
        auto recycling company to see if you can source the parts cheaper yourself.
        However, before buying anything, make sure the garage you have chosen will
        fit your parts. </p><h2>5) Learn how to do it yourself </h2><p>Ask friends
        and family or go on a basic car maintenance course so that you''re able to
        carry out ongoing checks and maybe even the odd repair yourself. With labour
        costs in garages upwards of \u00a340 per hour, learning how to change windscreen
        wipers, bulbs or even brake pads could save you hundreds of pounds. </p><h2>6)
