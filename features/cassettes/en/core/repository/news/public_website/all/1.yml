        a realistic budget. Our research found one in five recent first-time buyers
        would\u2019ve bought somewhere cheaper if they\u2019d known the true costs

        The new ISA limit of \u00a315,000 from1 July, means that basic-rate taxpayers
        who put the full amount in an ISA paying 1.5% will have a total of \u00a315,225
        after 12 months. </p><p>This is \u00a345 more than if the money is put in
        a standard savings account also paying 1.5% as the interest will be taxed.
        ISAs and other savings are a good idea - especailly if interest rates go up.
        </p><p>It''s worth noting that saving rather than paying off debts, such as\u00a0a
        credit card bill, may not be such a great idea. In this case the interest
        you are incurring when\u00a0paying off your cards will outstrip what you earn
        from savings. </p><p>See our guide, <a title=\"ISAs and other tax-efficient

        a month. For this outlay you can expect to receive a range of benefits, such
        as travel insurance and car breakdown cover. It''s worth considering when
        you''d use these extra benefits and whether you can buy them for less elsewhere.\u00a0
        </p><p>Also, check the exclusions, policy limitations\u00a0and eligibility

        around \u00a3185 per adult. Recent popular scams include fake dating websites
        which trick victims into calling premium rate phone numbers and fake lottery
        wins, which see you needing to send money in order to claim your winnings.
        Investment cons, such as boiler room scams\u00a0and pyramid schemes\u00a0are
        also to be avoided. </p><p>You can avoid losing out to fraudsters by never
        giving personal or financial information in response to unsolicited callers

        thinking of buy-to-let, there are differences to standard mortgages.","body":"<p
        class=\"intro\"> Buy-to-let mortgages might sound like a good way to make
        money, but they can be more expensive and risky than a standard house purchase
        - plus there are other expenses to bear in mind. </p><p> And even if you''ve
        already calculated you can afford the risk, there are some things you need
        to know. </p><p>New HSBC research shows rental properties in Southampton are
        yielding 8.73% gross which is the amount you receive a year in rent expressed
        as a percentage of the property\u2019s value. Manchester, Nottingham, Blackpool
        and Hull are the next best for returns. Meanwhile Brighton and Reading have
        the fastest growing returns as rental prices rise there. </p><p>They\u2019re
        lower in London as house prices have risen faster than rents. </p><p> See
        our advice below to see whether buy-to-let is right for you. </p><h2>It can
        be difficult to get one </h2><p>You\u2019ll struggle to get a buy-to-let mortgage
        if you don\u2019t already own your own home, whether outright or with an outstanding
        mortgage. And you are likely to find it hard to get a buy-to-let mortgage
        unless you earn at least \u00a325,000 a year. </p><p> You\u2019ll also need
        good credit and be able to finish the mortgage by the time you are 70. </p><p>

        mortgages\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/buy-to-let-mortgages\">Buy-to-let
        mortgages</a> guide. </p><h2>They''re not subject to the new mortgage rules
        </h2><p>Unlike buying a home to live in, the mortgage will be treated as a
        commercial loan, and as such it''s unregulated. That means you won''t necessarily
        go through the same affordability tests. Instead it will be based around your
        rental income - although some lenders will look at what you can afford based
        on income to check you can still make the payments when the property is empty.
        </p><p>The rental income will need to be verified by a surveyor and it will
        typically need to be 25% higher than the mortgage payment. So if your monthly
        payment is \u00a31000, the rent you charge needs to be at least \u00a31,250.
        </p><h2>Don\u2019t forget the additional costs </h2><p>It\u2019s not just
        a solicitor you need to account for. You may have fees for letting agents,
        maintenance costs, special landlord and rent\u00a0insurances and even capital
        gains taxes when you sell. Plus the property could be empty between tenants.
        </p><p> There are also many other costs that come with any house purchase.

        a home more than they expected. </p><p> Read <a title=\"First-time buyers

        as \u2018pension liberation fraud\u2019- works by transferring a scheme member\u2019s
        pension savings to an arrangement that will allow them to access their funds

        such as terminal illness. </p><p>For the majority of people, promises of accessing
        your fund early will be bogus and are likely to result in serious tax consequences
        in addition to high arrangement fees. </p><h2>A multi-million pound con </h2><p>The
        industry estimates that the current loss to UK pension savers from this type
        of fraud is approximately \u00a3600 million. </p><p>You may be targeted through
        websites, mass texting or through cold calls. We\u2019ve even heard of some

        out information in response to an unsolicited text or call and should always
        make sure that you know who you are dealing with. Scammers often fail to advise
        people of the tax implications of receiving cash from their pension or the
        full extent of fees to be paid in relation to any onward investment. </p><p>They

        class=\"intro\">Cashback is a way that you can get money back on your shopping.
        The ''cash'' may be in the form of money put back into your account or points
        to pay for a purchase later on. </p><p>Though percentages can be small, if
        you use them as much as you can the money quickly adds up. </p><p>Here are
        our top 5 ways you can earn cashback. </p><h2>1. Through credit cards\u00a0
        </h2><p>If you sign up for a cashback credit card, each time you use the card
        on an eligible purchase you earn a percentage of your spend back. So for example
        if your card pays 1% cashback and you spend \u00a3100 in a shop, you will
        earn \u00a31. Remember to pay off your card in full each month to avoid high
        interest fees. </p><p>Read more about<a title=\"Cashback credit cards\" target=\"_blank\"
        href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/cashback-credit-cards\">
        Cashback credit cards</a>\u00a0 </p><h2>2. Through your bank account </h2><p>Many
        current accounts now offer an option for cashback, though they\u2019re not
        usually as good as credit cards. You often have to activate an offer through
        your online banking, and you might find the choice is limited. If the acount
        has a fee, think about whether\u00a0the benefits including cashback, are worth
        paying for the account.\u00a0 One bank account does offer cashback on direct
        debits for many of your household bills, mortgage payments with the bank and
        shopping but it comes with a monthly fee. </p><h2>3. Through cashback websites
        </h2><p>Sites such as TopCashback and Quidco will pay you a percentage of
        the purchase if you click through to online retailers via their links. So
        if the retailer you want to buy from is listed and offering 10%, you\u2019ll
        get that money back. It may\u00a0take\u00a0some time for this to happen.\u00a0
        Don''t let the cashback lure you into spending on things you cannot afford.\u00a0
        Instead treat these sites as an extra bonus when buying something you would
        have gone for in any case.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><h2>4. Through apps </h2><p>There
        are more and more apps for smart phones that let you take a snap of your supermarket
        receipt. If you\u2019ve bought any of the products they\u2019ve listed you\u2019ll
        get cashback. Once you hit a certain threshold, you can move the cash\u00a0to
        your current account. </p><h2>5. Through reward and loyalty cards </h2><p>You\u2019ve
        most likely been doing this for years but not thought of them as cashback.
        Instead you\u2019ll be earning points which you then use to pay for a purchase
        or convert to cash at the till.\u00a0 Points can often be worth double or
        more if they are converted\u00a0into\u00a0vouchers to spend elsewhere.\u00a0

        With a bit of planning ahead, you\u00a0can save cash when you\u2019re away,
        giving you more to spend while you''re on holiday. </p><p>Here are five of
        our top tips to help save cash while you\u2019re away. </p><h2 class=\" \">1.\u00a0You
        can take it with you when you go </h2><p>If you are going abroad, you will
        need to take some local currency with you to pay for essentials for food and
        drink, tips and taxis. </p><p>You can buy foreign currency from banks, bureaux
        de change, the Post Office, some shops and supermarkets, travel agents\u00a0and\u00a0specialist
        online providers. </p><p>Nearly all of them are commission-free, but rates
        vary widely.\u00a0 Use the internet to compare rates even for those providers
        that are on the high street.\u00a0 If you''re ordering your currency online,
        check the delivery charges or avoid them by arranging to pick up the cash
        at the airport. </p><p>Leaving it to the last minute means you''re likely
        to get far less foreign currency for your pounds\u00a0at the airport or ferry
        port. </p><p>Using your phone overseas (roaming) can cost a lot more than
        it does at home, particularly if you want to surf the web a lot, upload photos
        to social networking sites or check or send lots of emails. </p><p>You can
        even run up a big bill without actively using your phone as smartphones and
        3G/4G enabled tablets automatically seek out mobile connections and use them
        to update apps. </p><p>So unless you turn off data roaming before you go,
        these devices could be downloading data at standard rates throughout your
        stay without you realising it. </p><p>Check out the Ofcom guide on <a title=\"Using

        your mobile abroad</a></p><h2>2. Look for free fees </h2><p>Using your debit
        and credit cards on holiday often means that the exchange rate you''ll be
        given has a foreign usage loading fee from the card provider which\u00a0can
        add up to 3% to the cost, meaning \u00a3100 overseas will cost you \u00a3103.\u00a0Some
        cards will also add a minimum fee on top when you withdraw money from a cash
        machine and, in the case of some debit cards, when you use them to pay for
        something. </p><p>However, this isn''t always the case.\u00a0 Several credit
        cards and some debit cards have no loading fee and may even have no withdrawal
        fee for cash either, \u00a0making them the cheapest way to spend. There''s
        more detail on\u00a0<a title=\"Cheap cards to use abroad\" target=\"_blank\"
        href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/cheap-cards-to-use-abroad\">Cheap
        cards to use abroad</a>. </p><p>Make sure you let your bank know you are going
        away to avoid having your card stopped after a few transactions. </p><h2>3.\u00a0Pre-pay
        the holiday way </h2><p>If you don''t want to use your debit or credit cards,\u00a0then
        prepaid cards can often be a good way to spend money. These can be loaded
        up with cash before you go so you can spend without getting into debt, or
        being charged interest. </p><p>These cards are growing in popularity as a
        safe alternative to traveller\u2019s cheques as the money you load onto the
        card will be protected by a PIN\u00a0if it\u2019s lost or stolen.\u00a0You''ll
        usually be charged a fee to take money out at a\u00a0cash machine and to top
        up your funds.\u00a0The exchange rate is set at the time you put money onto
        the card. </p><p>With the pound very strong against the dollar and the euro
        right now, you''re locking into the current exchange rate. Of course you also
        run the risk that it''ll be worth even more by the time you travel.\u00a0

        Pay in the local currenecy </h2><p>It might sound like a good idea to pay
        in pounds. You''ll understand what you''re spending and it helps you keep
        track of your money. But the exchange rate is usually far worse than the one
        you''ll get from your card provider.\u00a0 So, if you are offered the choice
        of how to pay on your card, always choose the local currency.\u00a0\u00a0
        </p><h2 class=\" \">5.\u00a0Ensure that you\u2019re insured </h2><p>Travel
        insurance is essential, but complicated. Protect yourself properly by researching
        all your options rather than just choosing the cheapest. It also means you
        won\u2019t face a huge bill if you become unwell on holiday. </p><p>If you
        travel abroad more than twice a year, annual holiday insurance or multi-trip
        insurance is usually better value. </p><p>Most annual and single trip policies
        cover you for 90, 120 or even 180 days. Families can buy a policy to cover
        everyone but do check the\u00a0number of children included and their ages.
        </p><p>If you are planning on doing anything adventurous, like paragliding
        or scuba diving, you\u2019ll need extra cover. The \u2018adventure sports\u2019
        clause may include less obvious activities such as horse riding, mountain
        biking, canoeing and motorcycling. </p><p>See our advice on <a title=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/travel-money-options-cash-cards-and-travellers-cheques\"

        to a country within the European Economic Community or Switzerland, a free
        European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) allows you to receive emergency medical
        treatment on the same basis as the citizens of that country for free or a
        small charge. </p><p>It\u00a0won\u2019t cover on-going care, medicines and
        repatriation. For this reason it\u2019s not a replacement for travel insurance.
        Likewise, if you don\u2019t have an EHIC your travel insurer may insist you

        some top tips to help you have a great time and stay on budget. </p><h2>1.
        Plan before you go </h2><p>It\u2019s easy to get caught out in the moment
        and spend more than you intended. There are also many additional costs you

        </h2><p>As with any camping, you could find it pretty cold at night, even
        if the sun is shining all day. So don\u2019t forget to have a sleeping bag
        and some layers. If it\u2019s going to rain, take some wellies and a poncho
        before you set off. \u00a0If you don\u2019t own them already and don\u2019t
        want to buy any, see if you can borrow them. \u00a0Buying them at the festival

        tips and tricks to save money when shopping</a>. </p><h2>4. Take as much food
        and drink with you as you can </h2><p>Once inside the festival site, you\u2019ll
        find food and drink prices higher than normal. \u00a0If you\u2019re getting
        three meals and a late night (or is that early morning) snack, you could easily
        be spending \u00a330 a day. Think about bringing some food which doesn\u2019t
        go off quickly and drink with you, in a cool box if necessary. \u00a0 Many
        festival sites will have water fountains too, so rather than buying a new
        bottle each time you need a drink, just top it up. </p><h2>5. Bring cash to
        avoid fees and queues </h2><p>Most places to spend will only take cash, which
        means if you run out you\u2019ll have to queue up (probably for a very long
        time) to use a cash machine and will probably have to pay a transaction fee.
        Of course there\u2019s the risk then that if you lose your purse or wallet,
        you lose everything. So consider splitting it up and keeping it in different
        places. \u00a0Or you might want to buy a money belt to stash your cash away.

        agreed with your card provider. Given the rate you\u2019re offered will depend
        on your credit rating, it makes sense to do all you can to limit your reliance
        on credit. Look to increase your repayments until you are clear of debt. Even
        if this seems a tall order the sooner you start the quicker you\u2019ll get

        than eight out of ten homes for sale in England are unaffordable for the average
        working family looking to buy their first home. </p><p>New research from Shelter
        shows that in over half of the country, less than one in ten suitable homes
        on the market are affordable for a typical family. That\u2019s even assuming
        they are able to save the average deposit for a first time buyer. </p><p>For
        those hoping to buy with smaller deposits the situation is even worse with
        almost nine of out of ten homes for sale in England unaffordable for families
        with a 95% loan. </p><p>In 83 local authority areas, accounting for over a
        quarter of the country, there were fewer than 10 affordable homes for sale.
        </p><p>These areas included Cambridge where there were only three affordable
        homes for sale, and Brighton and Hove where there was just one. Alarmingly,
        in 14 local authority areas, including Ealing, Lewisham and Slough, there
        were no affordable homes for sale at all. </p><p><em>\u201cWhen a family looking
        to buy their first home searches a whole town for a place to live and finds
        nothing they can afford, it''s clear we\u2019re not just facing a housing
        shortage any more: it\u2019s a full-blown drought,\u201d </em>said Campbell
        Robb, chief executive of Shelter. </p><p>The chronic shortage of affordable
        homes isn\u2019t confined to London and the South East. In Exeter only 1%
        of homes on the market were affordable for the typical family (8 out of 553
        for sale) whilst in South Lakeland in the North West only 4% were affordable
        (43 out of 1,069 for sale). </p><p>As higher monthly mortgage costs push even
        more homes out of reach, single people have the least chance of getting a
        foot on the property ladder, with only seven out of every 100 homes on the
        market affordable for someone on an average wage. </p><p>Even couples without
        children, with two full-time incomes are likely to struggle. In a quarter
        of the country, fewer than ten out of every 100 homes for sale were affordable

        course cutting back will only help you save if you don\u2019t share the bill.
        \u00a0Three out of four people say they split the bill when out for dinner.
        Tell your friends at the start of the night that you\u2019re low on funds
        so they know you can\u2019t pay the same as them or cut back too. The same
        goes for other expensive outings. </p><p>Social Psychology expert Jenni Trent

        decision, then no one will think any less of you.\u201d </p><h3>3. Say no
        </h3><p>That fear of missing out or worries about letting people down might
        mean you don\u2019t want to say no. But if you don\u2019t have the money,
        getting into debt could be much worse.\u00a0 </p><p>\u201c\u2026real friends
        wouldn\u2019t pressure you to do something you really can\u2019t afford\u201d

        you can afford to spend and leave your card behind. Once you\u2019re out of

        half of the nation admits to falling into debt as a result of their social
        lives, new findings we release today reveal. </p><p>Our study of 3,000 UK
        adults shows the average \u2018social debt\u2019 among this group is \u00a31,260,
        with almost three in five of all UK adults saying they usually spend more
        than they plan to on social occasions. </p><p>Fear of appearing less-than-generous
        in front of friends is fuelling much of this debt with three in five worrying
        about appearing \u2018tight\u2019 or \u2018stingy\u2019 in front of others,
        and one in three adults admitting that this contributes to their overspending
        when out. </p><p>A lack of self-control is a key reason for \u2018social debt\u2019,
        with more than one in three simply \u2018getting carried away\u2019 and overspending.
        </p><p>Social pressures add to this with \u00a3341 spent on average a year
        solely to avoid looking \u2018tight\u2019 or \u2018stingy\u2019. Consequently,
        one in five people have cut back on food due to their social spending, and
        one in ten has not been able to pay utility bills. </p><p>Not being able to

        will interest rate rises affect you?","description":"Interest rates have been
        at a record low for five years, but what would be the impact on household
        finances if they start to rise?","body":"<p class=\"intro\"> Interest rates
        have been at a record low for more than five years, so what would be the impact
        on household finances if they start to rise? </p><p>For a start you can expect
        changes to\u00a0trackers\u00a0or standard variable mortgage rates\u00a0to
        kick in within a month of the base rate rising, increasing in\u00a0line with
        the\u00a0Bank of England announcing a change in base rate. Those with fixed
        rate mortgages will see no change until the end of their current deal but
        new fixed rate mortgage deals are likely to change before\u00a0the movement
        in the base rate and possibly rise\u00a0by more than any initial increase.
        </p><p>Savings are the other area that will be impacted by any fluctuation
        in the base rate, although how quickly account providers respond to a base
        rate increase is less certain. It\u2019s likely savings account interest rates
        will gradually increase, but not immediately.\u00a0 </p><h2>House prices may
        settle down\u2026 </h2><p>House prices have gone through the roof in recent
        times, rising by almost 7% a year with the average price being \u00a3172,000
        according to the Land Registry, as homebuyers took advantage of attractively-low
        <a title=\"Mortgages\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/mortgages-a-beginners-guide\">mortgage
        rates</a>. </p><p>The Bank of England base rate is currently at an all-time
        low, at 0.5%. As rates rise, it\u2019s likely some of the heat will go out
        of the housing market. If this happens, it could be good news for younger
        people in particular who have been unable to step on the property ladder,
        partly because of the high cost of houses and flats, and partly because they
        have been hit by high rents. </p><p>According to the latest HomeLet Rental
        Index the average UK rent was \u00a3848 a month in April, up 9% from the same
        time last year. Not only is this total higher than the average monthly mortgage
        repayment of \u00a3749 for first time buyers, rents are also rising at a faster
        rate than salaries, which have increased by 6% over the year. </p><h2>\u2026But
        mortgages could be harder to get </h2><p>Since April anyone wanting a mortgage
        needs to prove they can afford to make their repayments, while managing their
        other expenses. They face tougher checks and\u00a0need to show how they would
        cope with any predictable changes in their circumstances \u2013 such as starting
        a family - and, unsurprisingly, an increase in repayments if\u00a0interest
        rates rise. </p><p>The Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney expects
        interest rates to rise by up to 3% by around 2017. This would mean a homeowner
        with a \u00a3140,000 mortgage charging 3.4% in interest\u00a0would need to
        find an additional \u00a3171 a month if interest rates were to rise by 2%.
        If they were to rise by 3% these homeowners will need to find an extra \u00a3263
        a month. </p><p>For more on this see our guide <a title=\"New mortgage rules\"

        </p><h2>Good news for savers </h2><p>It\u2019s been lean times for savers,
        with interest rates having been incredibly low for years, meaning you\u2019d
        struggle to get an instant access savings account 2% or more. However, other
        factors have made things even worse. </p><p>Chief among these has been the
        lack of incentive for banks and building societies to attract customers. Various
        government initiatives, including the bank bailouts and the Funding for Lending
        scheme, have helped them over the past seven or so years. </p><p>Funding for
        lending has played a big role in keeping account interest rates so low. This
        scheme saw \u00a380 billion of taxpayer money loaned to banks and building
        societies who pledged to lend to businesses. As a result, they didn\u2019t
        have to woo customers by offering attractive rates, easing the pressure on
        the banks, but leaving savers with little to cheer about. </p><p>With the
        Funding for Lending scheme ending in early 2015, banks will once again need
        to turn to customers for the money they require to invest to make profits,
        leading to higher interest rates on accounts. </p><p><em>Photo: PA</em></p>","date":"2014-06-23T15:49:17+00:00"},{"id":"free-or-fee-does-it-make-sense-to-pay-for-a-current-account","title":"Free

        Supermarket giant Tesco has thrown its hat in the current account ring, following
        the likes of TSB and Marks &amp; Spencer, but this time with a new twist on
        paid-for accounts. </p><p>Basically, you need to put in \u00a3750 a month
        to access a raft of\u00a0benefits. If you don''t, you have to pay a fee. </p><p>
        Around 9 million of us currently pay for a packaged account, according to
        market analysts Mintel. Generally speaking you can get\u00a0one for around
        \u00a315 a month, but whether you''re a customer with a new provider or a
        well-established one, it''s important to weigh up the pros and cons. </p><h2>What
        is a packaged account? </h2><p>A <a title=\"Packaged accounts\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/packaged-accounts\">packaged
        account</a> can combine a number of benefits,\u00a0including\u00a0travel insurance,
        mobile phone cover, preferential foreign exchange rates and even music and
        film downloads. </p><p>You can expect to earn up to to 3% in interest from
        a packaged account provider, get preferential foreign exchange rates and interest-free
        overdrafts, among other benefits. But, considering the typical monthly outlay
        of \u00a315, this means you\u2019re quids out unless you make very good use
        of the benefits. </p><p>Most banks offer a packaged account or two, but you
        should search the market for the <a title=\"Current accounts\" href=\"https://compare.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/currentaccounts/Step1?language=en\">best
        current accounts</a> to switch to and check the limitations on any benefits
        that appeal. </p><h2>Packaged accounts: Worldwide travel insurance </h2><p>Typically
        you can expect to get <a title=\"Travel insurance\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/a-good-travel-insurance-policy\">travel
        insurance</a> covering Europe or worldwide trips. But if you are 40 years
        old and want worldwide cover (including the USA and Canada) it\u2019s possible
        to buy quality annual travel insurance from around \u00a335 for you and your
        partner. </p><p>If you are older, say 75, the cost of worldwide cover goes
        up significantly \u2013 costing from around \u00a3220 for a couple or \u00a3150
        for an individual. </p><p>Many packaged account policies won\u2019t cover
        you once you hit a certain age, such as\u00a070 or 75, so this key benefit
        isn\u2019t worth paying for if you are over the age threshold. In some cases
        you can pay a packaged account provider an additional premium of \u00a350
        to secure travel insurance, but this is only worth paying for if you intend
        to travel outside of Europe and can\u2019t get a better deal by going direct.
        </p><h2>Packaged accounts: European travel insurance </h2><p>If you look on
        comparison sites, you\u2019ll see several packaged account providers only
        offer European travel insurance, which you can get from around \u00a310 for
        an individual, or \u00a320 for couple \u2013 both aged 40. This makes packaged
        accounts an expensive perk for people who only make use of this feature. </p><h2>Packaged
        accounts: Mobile phone insurance </h2><p><a title=\"Do you need mobile phone
        insurance?\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/do-you-need-mobile-phone-insurance\">Mobile
        phone insurance</a> is another possible benefit. Yet again, you must ask yourself
        if it\u2019s worth the outlay. On this point it''s worth considering this
        benefit as a big plus - especially as although many home insurers will cover
        you for loss or damage to a phone, the adverst effect on your annual\u00a0premium,
        and on your no claims discount might disuade you from making a home policy
        claim. </p><h2>Packaged accounts: Car breakdown policies </h2><p>Car breakdown
        cover is often included, provided by the likes of Green Flag or the RAC. It
        is available from around \u00a327 direct, rising to more than \u00a380, so
        it could be a valuable addition for drivers - providing the policy has the
        level of protection you''d require. For this reason always read the small
        print so you know what is excluded. </p><h2>Identity\u00a0theft support </h2><p>Several
        packaged accounts feature ID theft support. One packaged account provider\u2019s
        website states: \u2018If your personal details are used to commit fraud it
        may damage your credit history, or leave you in debt.\u2019 </p><p>This may
        be the case, but if you are a victim of fraud you can claim back money taken
        from your account, as your provider is obliged to refund you for losses incurred
        through theft.\u00a0 </p><p>Likewise, your credit report should be corrected
        by the relevant credit reference agency once you contact them. This is not
        a benefit you should have to pay for \u2013 unless you are not inclined to
        do the leg work. </p><h2>Other packaged account perks </h2><p><strong>Extended
        warranties</strong> \u2013 These are designed to cover you for 12 months after
        your manufacturer warranty ends, even if you have purchased the goods before
        taking out the packaged account. While <a title=\"Extended warranties - are
        they worth it?\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/extended-warranties-are-they-worth-it\">extended
        warranties</a> seem a good deal, they may be redundant. </p><p>If you have
        purchased an appliance that malfunctions, you can lodge a claim with the provider
        under the Sale of Goods Act 1979. All items must be fit for purpose, so if
        it\u2019s reasonable to expect your buy to last for more than a year you can
        get your money back or a like-for-like replacement. </p><p><strong>Multi-media</strong>
        \u2013 It\u2019s common for packaged accounts to include film and music downloads.
        You can get three Amazon Prime rental DVDs a month or five hmvdigital music
        downloads a month with providers such as RBS. Currently you can rent DVDs
        and Blu-rays for \u00a37.99 a month (or \u00a36.99 if you are a Amazon Prime
        member). </p><p>Hmvdigital downloads can cost from 99p to more than \u00a39,
        depending on whether you buy a single or an album, so if you are a music aficionado,
        this could prove an attractive deal. </p><h2>Check the key features </h2><p>If
        you don\u2019t intend to travel abroad, aren\u2019t interested in breakdown
        cover or regularly buy music then a packaged account may not be ideal. However,
        if you welcome at least one of these features, the outlay could be worthwhile.
        Even so, it is worth checking the key features of each benefit to ensure they
        are suitable and you can use them to their full potential.\u00a0 </p><p><em>

        class=\"intro\">The days of popping to your local travel agent to book your
        holiday are on the wane. As online bookings increase, here\u2019s how to make
        sure you stay safe. </p><p>Only 18% of shoppers arranged their holiday in
        a high street travel agent in the last two years while a quarter of Britons
        did it online, according to Mintel\u2019s annual British Lifestyles report.
        </p><p>The move to researching and buying online has been helped by the rise
        of comparison sites for flights, hotels, car hire\u00a0and much more. </p><p>If
        you\u2019re planning your holiday, here are tips for getting one online. </p><h2>Use
        websites you trust </h2><p>There are hundreds of websites offering cheap flights
        and accommodation. Make sure they are legitimate and check customer feedback.
        Look for ABTA membership for agencies and ATOL protection for airlines if
        you\u2019re buying a package. </p><p>It\u2019s also important to check the
        security of the site itself before going ahead. Look for a padlock symbol
        and web address starting https. </p><p>If you''re booking a villa or apartment
        directly from the owner, look on TripAdvisor to see if other visitors have
        commented on it or check on internet forums using its name.\u00a0 Some unfortunate
        holidaymakers have been caught out finding the accommodation is nothing like
        the pictures or, in extreme cases, doesn''t even exist. </p><p>Don''t forget
        to buy travel insurance at the same time as booking your holiday.\u00a0 Check
        for exclusions and\u00a0top up cover if it isn''t enough for your needs. </p><p>For

        try to save beforehand so you can pay the card off in full straight away.
        </p><p>In some cases, if you buy a flight only from a third party, such as
        a travel agent, you may not be able to make a claim because the third party

        goers warned to make sure they\u2019re covered","description":"Valuables could
        be at risk this summer if not covered by insurance","body":"<p class=\"intro\">Only
        half of the thousands of adults planning to attend a music festival this summer
        have cover for their valuables, according to research from Gocompare.com.
        </p><p>Over the past few years it''s become the norm for festival goers to
        take expensive items such as iPhones and tablet computers with them. </p><p>Festivals
        are an easy target for opportunist thieves with potentially thousands of valuables
        left in unsecured tents or for pickpockets in tightly packed crowds. </p><p>Concert
        goers could also risk losing or breaking valuables in festival crowds or camping
        grounds. In 2012, there were over 700 lost items handed in during the Glastonbury
        festival, including 118 mobiles and 38 cameras. </p><p>Without cover for items
        away from home, festival goers won''t be insured should their items go missing.
        </p><p>Gocompare.com has put together a list of five must-dos for UK festival
        goers to keep their possessions safe this summer: </p><h2>1. Get it covered
        </h2><p>It''s worth considering adding cover to your home insurance policy
        for expensive items you are taking away from home. This may increase the cost
        of your home insurance, but then it could prove to be a worthwhile investment
        should you need to make a claim. </p><p>Before going to a festival, check
        your insurance documents to make sure you''re aware of the level of cover
        that you have. For example, though most home insurance policies with cover
        away from home will protect your items if they are lost or stolen whilst you''re
        carrying them, some will class anything you leave in your tent as ''unattended''
        and will not foot the bill if they are lost or stolen, even if your tent was
        locked. </p><p>It''s also important to consider that the amount your insurer
        will pay out for your lost or stolen phone can vary. For instance, some insurers
        will cover the full value of your mobile, while others may only pay up to
        a fixed amount, such as \u00a3150. So it''s worth checking to make sure that
        you have the right cover for any of the valuables you''re considering taking
        with you. </p><h2>2. Do you really need it? </h2><p>Though it sometimes feels
        like we''re joined at the hip to our gadgets, it''s worth considering if you
        really need to take them with you in the first place. </p><p>You could even
        invest in a cheap mobile phone so that you can temporarily downgrade from
        your smartphone to one that is less attractive to thieves. </p><p>Also, it''s
        worth noting that using apps and features like 3G will drastically reduce
        your smartphone''s battery life, so unless you want to spend your weekend
        queuing to charge your phone, a model with less frills could be a better fit
        for you. </p><h2>3. If you''re in a tent, lock it </h2><p>If somebody is looking
        to get into your tent, they''ll probably be able to regardless of whether
        there''s a padlock on the zip or not. But it''s worth considering that a proportion
        of crimes at festivals will be opportunistic and thieves will be looking to
        take advantage of unsecured tents. </p><p>By putting a lock on your tent you''re
        making it more difficult for somebody to gain access and would-be criminals
        will be more likely to move on to one of the thousands of other tents that
        are not locked. </p><h2>4. Spread your valuables out and lock them away </h2><p>For
        things that you absolutely have to take - like your wallet, ID, cash or keys
        - it''s worth considering getting a locker to house them. Most UK festivals
        offer locker facilities for a fee. The lockers available are usually quite
        small, but should be large enough for things like money, wallets and phones.
        </p><p>When you''re carrying cash remember to spread it around. By hiding
        your money in small amounts around yourself and your tent, you''ll make it
        harder for thieves to find. </p><h2>5. Going abroad? Get travel insurance
        </h2><p>Overseas festivals are becoming increasingly popular amongst Brits.
        But if you''re planning on going abroad travel insurance and an EHIC (European
        Health Insurance Card) are just as important as your tent and your ticket.
        </p><p>You''ll need travel insurance should you get ill or injured, or if
        for you need to cancel your trip. Without travel insurance you could face
        running up thousands of pounds in medical bills with no way to return back
        to the UK </p><p>When taking out travel insurance, it''s important to read
        your policy documentation carefully as there will usually be conditions. These
        could include not leaving your items unattended or certain alcohol-related
        exclusions. Consider these before deciding whether the policy is right for
        you. </p><p>Most policies will accept that you''re likely to drink alcohol
        while away, but will not cover you if the police or a doctor believe your
        alcohol consumption was a major factor in an incident. </p><p>Festivals can
        be a great way to spend a long weekend with friends and family this summer,
        but it''s important to remember to take care of your valuables. Unfortunately,
        there are people who look to take advantage of us when we let our guard down
        to have fun, and although security staff usually do an excellent job at these
        events, it''s important to stay vigilant. </p><h2>Find out more </h2><p><a
