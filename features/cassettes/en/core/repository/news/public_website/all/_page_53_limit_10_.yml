        Advice Service consults on improving debt advice in the UK","description":"The
        Money Advice Service has begun a 12 week consultation on quality standards
        within the debt advice sector in the UK","body":"<p><strong> Date published:
        19 December 2012\u00a0</strong></p><p class=\"intro\">The Money Advice Service
        has begun a 12 week consultation on quality standards within the debt advice
        sector in the UK. </p><p>We took on responsibility for the co-ordination of
        the sector earlier in 2012, with a remit to improve the accessibility, quality
        and consistency of debt advice. </p><p>The quality of debt advice is recognised
        to vary across the country and the new consultation invites views on a framework
        which will set a benchmark for debt advice delivery and bring about greater
        consistency. </p><p>The framework has been informed by an independent review
        carried out by the Money Advice Trust, which found that there is great diversity
        in the way debt advice is delivered, monitored and accredited. </p><p>It will
        apply to organisations and individuals working in the sector and is designed
        to build upon the good practice which already exists. </p><p>We are proposing
        that three principles for organisations sit at the heart of the framework:
        being receptive to client needs, demonstrating strong governance and promoting
        reflective and on-going learning. </p><p>The framework proposes greater clarity
        around the role profiles of debt advisers and sets out a minimum range of
        skills, knowledge and competencies for individuals working in the sector.
        </p><p>Following the consultation, the Money Advice Service will finalise
        details of the framework. It will then work with those operating in the sector,
        including organisations not currently funded by the Service, to ensure that
        the standards they follow meet the new benchmark. </p><p>By April 2014, organisations
        which receive funding from the Money Advice Service will need to demonstrate
        that the standards they follow are in line with the framework. </p><p><a href=\"/en/static/money-advice-service-consults-on-improving-the-quality-of-debt-advice-in-the-uk\">Read
