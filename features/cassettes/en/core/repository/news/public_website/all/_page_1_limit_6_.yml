        a small electric city car to avoid paying tax - there\u2019s more choice than

        a car is. It is based on how many grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) it emits per
        kilometre driven. </p><p>There are 13 tax bands with costs ranging from \u00a30

        Tiptronic S (includes \u00a35,000 government plug-in car grant) qualifies
        for \u00a30 car tax. </p><p>The big 4x4 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV 2.0 GX3h

        rate? </h2><p>The amount that a vehicle depreciates varies depending on the
        make, model, year, type and other factors associated with the car. </p><p>If
        you are looking to retain as much value as you can for your new car, there
        are some tips that will influence the rate of depreciation for your vehicle.<strong><br/>Mileage</strong>
        \u2013 the average mileage is around 10,000 per year. The more miles, the
        less your car is worth. </p><p><strong>Reliability</strong> \u2013 some cars
        have a reputation for unreliability. This can be based on <a title=\"The most
        reliable cars to own\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/the-most-reliable-cars-to-own\">customer
        satisfaction surveys</a></p><p><strong>Number of owners</strong> \u2013 the
        fewer the better. So check the number of previous owners on the car\u2019s
        logbook or V5C registration. </p><p><strong>General condition</strong> \u2013
        damage to the bodywork, interior and exterior will reduce value. Make sure
        you <a title=\"How to test drive and check a used car\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-test-drive-and-check-a-used-car\">inspect
        a used car </a>carefully before buying. </p><p><strong>Service history</strong>
        \u2013 the more complete this is the better. The service book should have
        stamps/receipts showing servicing in line with the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.
        </p><p><strong>Length of warranty</strong> \u2013 three years is good, but
        some manufacturers now offer as long as seven years, which is a bonus when
        selling your car. </p><p><strong>Desirability</strong> \u2013 some models
        are \u2018face-lifted\u2019 or replaced every few years, while some go on
        for 10 or more. The more recent the model, the better it will hold its value.
        </p><p><strong>Size</strong> \u2013 big luxury cars tend to depreciate more
        than smaller cars because they cost more to run and have higher bill for parts
        and maintenance. </p><p><strong>Fuel economy</strong> \u2013 the more miles
        per gallon the better for many buyers. This is one reason why diesels cars
        hold their value slightly better than petrol cars, although it\u2019s becoming
        less true as petrol car engine efficiency improves. </p><p><strong>Road Fund
        Licence (road tax) </strong>is also a consideration. Fuel guzzling cars cost
        much more to tax each year, which makes them less desirable when selling second-hand.\u00a0
        </p><h2>Tips for minimising depreciation </h2><ul><li> Do your research before
        buying a car \u2013 search the most up-to-date <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.whatcar.com/car-depreciation-calculator/\">What

        credits and other help with childcare costs </a></p><p>Remember that tax credits
        can only be used to pay for registered or approved provision, so check if
        this applies to any holiday club you are considering, before signing up. Childcare
        vouchers from your employer can also be used to pay towards registered childcare.

        holidays doesn\u2019t have to break the bank, if you take advantage of cheap
        and free activities in your local area. </p><h3>1. Plan for playschemes </h3><p>See
        if your local authority, schools, <a title=\"Sure start centres\" target=\"_blank\"
        href=\"http://childrenscentresfinder.direct.gov.uk/childrenscentresfinder\">Sure
        Start Centres</a>, churches and community groups run any playschemes or holiday
        clubs during the summer holidays. If you receive income support, benefits
        or tax credits, your children may qualify for a discount on any charges. </p><h3>2.
        Look up your local leisure centre </h3><p>Again, low income families may qualify
        for concessions at your local leisure centre or swimming pool. Check the timetable
        for family swimming sessions, or see if your children would like to try different
        classes and sports. </p><h3>3. Locate your library </h3><p>Investigate activities
        at your local library, from story time for toddlers to craft activities, reading
        groups and even writing sessions for older children. </p><p>Most libraries
        run the <a title=\"Summer reading challenge\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://summerreadingchallenge.org.uk/\">Summer
        Reading Challenge</a>, which is completely free. It encourages children aged
        between four and eleven years old to read six books from the library during
        their summer holiday with rewards like posters, stickers and bookmarks. </p><h3>4.
        Make the most of museums and galleries </h3><p>Many museums and galleries
        offer free entrance to their main collections, and may also run special exhibitions,
        events or arts and crafts sessions for children. </p><h3>5. Have fun with
        a film </h3><p>Cinemas often offer cut-price tickets to family films during
        weekends and school holidays, if you are willing to go to a morning showing.
        </p><h3>6. Ride the railway </h3><p>If you fancy going further afield, consider
        buying a <a title=\"Family &amp; Friends railcard\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.familyandfriends-railcard.co.uk/\">Family
        &amp; Friends Railcard</a> to cut the cost of train fares. A one-year card
        costs \u00a330, but can then save you a third off adult tickets and 60% off
        children\u2019s fares. </p><h3>7. Take advantage of 2 for 1 tickets </h3><p>If
        you buy National Rail tickets, you can also get two tickets for the price
        of one on loads of child-friendly activities like zoos, aquariums, theme parks,
        theatres and exhibitions. Register at <a title=\"Days out guide\" target=\"_blank\"
        href=\"http://www.daysoutguide.co.uk/\">Days Out Guide</a>, work out where
        you would like to go, and then print out the relevant vouchers to take along.
        </p><h3>8. Save with supermarket vouchers </h3><p>If you use a supermarket
        loyalty card when you shop, check if you can exchange points or vouchers for
        days out, meals and travel. With some schemes, your points can be worth two
        or four times as much when used to pay for activities, compared to using them
        for money off your shopping. </p><h3>9. Think of the theatre </h3><p>Going
        to the theatre need not cost an arm and a leg if you look out for offers and
        discounted tickets. </p><p>For example, kids go free to top London shows during
        <a title=\"Kids week\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kidsweek.co.uk/\">Kids
        Week</a>, which actually runs for the whole of August. If you can afford an
        adult ticket, then one child under 16 goes free, and you can buy tickets for
        another two children at half price. </p><h3>10. Pack a picnic </h3><p>A picnic
        in a local park can become a fun day out in itself. Also, meals out can really
        drive up the cost of any activity, so plan ahead and take food, drinks and
        snacks whenever you head off. </p><p><em>Photo:\u00a0PA</em></p>","date":"2014-07-23T10:18:41+00:00"},{"id":"five-summer-driving-fuel-economy-tips","title":"Five
        summer driving fuel economy tips","description":"Find out how to drive your
        car more economically during the summer months","body":"<p class=\"intro\">Millions
        of cars take to the roads in the summer during the school holidays. </p><p>Packed
        with kids and luggage, they are not at their most economical so it''s more
        important than ever to squeeze as many miles as you can from your car''s fuel
        tank. </p><p><a title=\"Cheap petrol and diesel\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/choosing-between-petrol-and-diesel-power\">Shopping
        around for the cheapest petrol or diesel </a>and avoiding expensive motorway
        service stations will help, but there are other things you can try too...
        </p><h2>Air conditioning or windows? </h2><p>Air-conditioning increases fuel
        consumption, especially at low speeds. If it\u2019s a hot day, use the air
        conditioning for high speed driving, but open the windows around town. </p><h2>Adjust
        your driving style </h2><p>Read the road ahead, anticipating the actions of
        other drivers and potential hazards. The less braking and acceleration, the
        less fuel used. For instance, drive smoothly in heavy traffic, so avoid driving
        fast to catch up to the car in front, then having to brake. Broadly speaking,
        the smoother your drive, the more miles per gallon. </p><p>According to the
        AA, driving at 70mph uses up to 9% more fuel than at 60mph and up to 15% more
        than at 50mph. Cruising at 80mph can use up to 25% more fuel than at 70mph.
        For instance, driving 100 motorway miles at 70mph might cost you \u00a315
        at 70mph, but \u00a320 at 80mph. </p><p>Finally, watch and listen to your
        revs. Some drivers let the revs (revolutions per minute or RPM) run to 3,000
        per minute (petrol car) and 2,500 (diesel) before changing up a gear. It\u2019s
        more efficient to move up a gear at 2,500 (petrol) and 2,000 (diesel). Also,
        use high gears such as fifth and sixth gears sooner than later. </p><h2>Keep
        your car maintained </h2><p>Get your car serviced regularly to maintain engine
        efficiency and make sure you\u2019re using the correct engine oil (check the
        handbook). </p><p>Well maintained tyres are essential for safe and economical
        driving. Check tyres pressures regularly (especially before a motorway journey).
        The RAC claims that correctly inflated tyres can improve fuel consumption
        by up to 2% </p><h2>Stay slippery </h2><p>Broadly speaking the most aerodynamic
        cars are the most fuel efficient cars. </p><p>Wind resistance increases fuel
        consumption, so try to keep windows closed at high speeds and remove roof
        racks and boxes when not in use. Removing a roof-top cargo box can save as
        much as 20% on fuel over a year. </p><h2>Reduce weight </h2><p>Lighter cars
        use less fuel, so don\u2019t drive around with unnecessary items in your boot
        and unless you\u2019re on a long journey, consider running your fuel tank
        half full or less. </p><p>Read our full guide to <u><a title=\"Guide to buying,
