        credit or refused a loan - What you can do","description":"If you\u2019ve
        been turned down for credit find out what steps you can take to find out why","body":"<p
        class=\"intro\"><img src=\"/images/what-to-do-if-you-have-been-refused-a-loan-or-credit-card.jpg\"/>If
        you\u2019ve been turned down for a credit card or loan there are steps you
        can take to understand why. There are also things you should avoid doing which
        could make it even harder for you to get credit in the future. Read on to
        find out more and to learn about alternative borrowing options to consider
        or avoid. </p><h2>What you should be told if you have been refused credit
        or a loan </h2><p>If you\u2019re turned down for a loan or credit card, the
        credit card or loan company should tell you whether you were turned down as
        a result of a search on your credit file and, if so, which credit reference
        agency they used. You can ask for more information about why you were refused
        but they don\u2019t have to give you a detailed reply. However mistakes can
        happen and if you do spot a mistake, write to the credit reference agency
        and ask for it to be corrected immediately. Make sure you include an explanation
        about why it''s wrong, and include any evidence you have. The agency has 28
        days to act, and the relevant detail in your credit report will be marked
        as ''disputed'' while it is investigated. </p><h2>Don\u2019t keep applying
        </h2><p>You might ask ''why have I been refused credit?''. If you have been
        refused a loan or turned down for a credit card, the worst thing you can do
        is to keep applying for more credit because any credit applications you make
        \u2013 whether or not you\u2019ve been successful \u2013 will show up on your
        credit file. Several applications in a short space of time may make lenders
        think you are desperate for cash and this will damage your credit rating further.
        Your credit rating affects whether you can get credit, how much you can borrow
        and \u2013 sometimes \u2013 the interest rate you may be charged. </p><h2>What
        to do next </h2><p>What to do next depends on why you are looking for credit.
        </p><h3>If you need to borrow to pay off other debts </h3><p>If you\u2019re
        looking to borrow in order to pay off other debts or to help you pay bills
        and living expenses at the end of the month then it\u2019s worth talking to
        a free debt adviser as soon as you can. They will be able to help you come
        up with a plan and avoid getting deeper into debt. Follow the link below for
        more information. </p><p><a title=\"Where to go to get free debt advice\"

        purchase and can afford the repayments </h3><p>If you\u2019re looking for
        credit to fund a purchase, such as buying a car, and you can afford the credit
        or loan repayments, then check your <strong>credit rating</strong>. You do
        this by getting hold of your credit report \u2013 this is crucial in influencing
        the lender\u2019s decision about whether to give you credit or not. </p><p>You
        can see your report by subscribing to a full credit report service or just
        buying a one-off report. </p><p><a title=\"How to check your credit report\"

        Before you look to borrow elsewhere </h2><p>If you\u2019ve been turned down
        for a loan or card it could be a good opportunity for you to think about your
        current money situation. </p><p>If you already have debts you\u2019re struggling
        to repay, you should talk to someone about them. There are a number of organisations
        that offer free, confidential debt advice. </p><p><a title=\"Where to go to

        you have a poor credit rating </h2><p>If you need to borrow some money for
        a purchase and you can afford the repayments, there are other options beyond
        credit cards and personal loans. </p><h3>Credit unions </h3><p>If you need
        to borrow some money at an affordable interest rate, find out if there is
        a credit union near you. Credit unions are non-profit organisations that have
        been set up to help people in their local communities. There\u2019s a cap
        on the amount of interest they can charge on their loans of 2% a month or
        26.8% a year APR and there are no hidden charges or penalties if you repay
        the loan early. With some credit unions, you have to save for a period before
        you''re allowed to borrow. </p><p><a title=\"Borrowing from a credit union\"

        the Social Fund </h3><p>If you desperately need to borrow money, you may be
        able to apply for an interest-free Budgeting Loan from the Social Fund. Alternatively,
        other help may be available from your local authority in England, or the Scottish
        and Welsh governments. </p><p><a title=\"Budgeting loans from the Social fund\"

        </h3><p>Think carefully before borrowing using payday loans, home credit or
        by using a pawnbroker. And avoid illegal loan sharks altogether. </p><p><strong>Payday
        loans</strong></p><p>Taking out a payday loan can be a very expensive way
        to borrow. It\u2019s also all too easy to roll over your loans from month
        to month and lender to lender, leading to your initial debt quickly growing
        into an unmanageable one. </p><p><a title=\"Payday loans\" data-type=\"link\"

        to Payday loans</a></p><p><strong>Home credit or doorstep lending </strong></p><p>Home
        credit, also known as doorstep lending, is when a salesperson lends you money
        at your home. It can be very expensive so think very carefully before you
        take on this type of loan. For example, if you borrow at a high interest rate,
        will you be able to pay off your loan? Make sure you only use a licensed lender
        and don\u2019t borrow from anyone who calls at your house you offering a loan
        as this is illegal. </p><p><a title=\"Home credit or doorstep lending\" data-type=\"link\"

        more in our guide Home credit or doorstep lending</a></p><p><strong>Pawnbrokers</strong></p><p>Pawnbrokers
        will lend you money but at higher rates of interest than high street banks
        and you\u2019ll have to leave something valuable, normally jewellery, as security.
        The item is known as a \u2018pawn\u2019. If you can\u2019t pay back your debt,
        you\u2019ll lose your item. </p><p>For extra peace of mind, check that your
        pawnbroker is a member of the National Pawnbrokers Association, a central
        organisation that promotes high standards of business conduct. </p><p><a title=\"Pawnbrokers

        more in Pawnbrokers \u2013 how they work</a></p><p><strong>Loan sharks</strong></p><p>Loan
        sharks are illegal lenders who often target low income and desperate families.
        They may seem friendly at first but borrowing from them is never a good idea
        \u2013 even if your credit rating is poor or you only need a small amount
        for a short while. Avoid them at all costs. </p><p>As they are not licensed,
        loan sharks will charge extortionate rates of interest and you may be harassed
        if you get behind with your repayments. If you owe money to a loan shark,
        you do not have to pay it back as they are illegal. Report them to the Stop
        Loan Sharks team. </p><p><a title=\"Loan sharks\" data-type=\"link\" hreflang=\"en\"

        you want to sell old gold there are several different options to choose from
        including postal gold websites, specialist gold merchants, TV gold websites
        and traditional pawnbrokers. Think very carefully if you are considering selling
