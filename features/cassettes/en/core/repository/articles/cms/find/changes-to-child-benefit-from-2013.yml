        people earning \u00a350,000+","description":"The rules for Child Benefit changed
        in January 2013 - find out how the changes affect you and what your options
        are","body":"<p class=\"intro\"><img alt=\"Changes to Child Benefit from 2013\"
        src=\"/images/changes-to-child-benefit-from-2013.jpg\"/>If either you or your
        partner has an income of more than \u00a350,000 a year then you have to pay
        back some or all of your Child Benefit in the form of extra Income Tax. Read
        on to find out more. </p><h2>You and your partner each earn less than \u00a350,000
        per year </h2><p>If you and your partner each has an income of less than \u00a350,000
        a year, you will receive the full amount of Child Benefit without having to
        pay any of it back. </p><h2>Either you or your partner earns between \u00a350,000
        and \u00a360,000 per year </h2><p>If either you or your partner has an income
        of between \u00a350,000 and \u00a360,000 a year each, you have to pay a proportion
        of your Child Benefit back in extra Income Tax. </p><h3>How does this work?
        </h3><p>You still get paid the full amount of Child Benefit each month (or
        each week if you''re paid weekly). However, whichever one of you has the higher
        income has to pay more Income Tax to repay the proportion of Child Benefit
        you''re no longer entitled to. </p><p>You need to fill in a Self Assessment
        tax return so that HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) can calculate the amount
        of extra Income Tax you have to pay. </p><h3>How much do you have to pay back?
        </h3><p>Basically, you pay back 1% of your family''s Child Benefit for every
        extra \u00a3100 of income over \u00a350,000. </p><p><strong>For example</strong></p><p>Katya
        and Leroy have a baby. Katya is staying at home to look after the baby. Leroy
        earns \u00a351,000 a year. Leroy has to pay extra tax to repay some of their
        Child Benefit. His income is 10 x \u00a3100 over the limit, so the extra tax
        is 10% of their Child Benefit of \u00a320.30 per week. He pays extra tax of
        \u00a3105 a year. </p><p><a title=\"Child Benefit tax calculator\" data-link-type=\"external\"

        per year </h2><p>If either you or your partner has an income of more than
        \u00a360,000 a year, you have to repay all of your Child Benefit as Income
        Tax. </p><h3>How does this work? </h3><p>You still get paid the full amount
        of Child Benefit each month (or each week if you''re paid weekly). However,
        whichever one of you has the higher income has to pay back the full amount
        in the form of Income Tax. </p><p>You need to fill in a Self Assessment tax
        return so that HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) can calculate the extra Income
        Tax you have to pay. </p><h2>What to do if you''re a new parent </h2><p>Make
        sure you still put in your claim for Child Benefit \u2013 even if you''re
        earning over \u00a350,000 and you''ve decided not to take the payments. This
        is really important because if you don\u2019t, you will miss out on: </p><ul><li>National
        Insurance credits that protect your entitlement to State Pension</li><li>Other
        benefits such as Guardian''s Allowance</li><li>Your child being automatically
        issued with a National Insurance number before their 16th birthday</li></ul><p><a

        class=\"yes\">This avoids the hassle of paying additional tax</li><li class=\"yes\">You
        won''t have to complete a tax return</li><li class=\"no\">If your income is
        between \u00a350,000 and \u00a360,000, you''ll end up out of pocket since
        you''ll be giving up the proportion of Child Benefit that you are still entitled
        to</li></ul><h3>How to stop your payments </h3><p>You should let HMRC know
        you want to stop your payments. </p><p><a title=\"Stop Child Benefit payments\"

        your income is between \u00a350,000 and \u00a360,000, you will still get however
        much you''re entitled to</li><li class=\"yes\">Even if you''re earning over
        \u00a360,000, if you put your Child Benefit aside in a savings account you
        can earn interest on the money before you have to pay your tax bill</li><li
        class=\"no\">You will need to pay the extra tax</li><li class=\"no\">You''ll
        have to complete a tax return</li></ul><h3>Register for Self Assessment </h3><p>If
