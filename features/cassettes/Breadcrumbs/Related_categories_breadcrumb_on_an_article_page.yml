        you afford to buy a property and, even if you can, is it a good idea \u2013
        or would you be better off renting instead?","body":"<html><body><p class=\"intro\"><img
        src=\"/images/should-you-rent-or-buy.jpg\"/>Buying a property is probably
        the biggest financial decision you\u2019ll ever have to make. How do you know
        whether it\u2019s the right decision for you right now \u2013 or whether you\u2019d
        be better off renting instead? </p><h2>Mortgage\u00a0or rent? </h2><p>Owning
        your own home is a huge commitment, not just to the building you buy and the
        area you choose to live in, but also to your life (and to another person if
        you are buying with a loved one or friend). </p><h3>Benefits of owning your
        home </h3><p>There are many benefits to home ownership. Here are just some
        of them. </p><ul><li>Once you\u2019ve paid off your mortgage, your home will
        be yours and it could be worth far more than you paid for it. </li></ul><ul><li>If
        your home increases in value you can use that equity to help you afford a
        bigger home or to fund a more comfortable retirement if you downsize. </li></ul><ul><li>When
        you retire you won\u2019t necessarily have the income you need to keep on
        paying rent \u2013 if you have paid your mortgage off you\u2019ll be living
        there \u2018rent free\u2019. </li></ul><ul><li>You can spend money improving
        your home and increasing its value, whereas you can\u2019t alter a rented
        home without the landlord\u2019s permission. </li></ul><ul><li>Sometimes it
        can be cheaper to buy than to rent.</li></ul><h3>Potential downsides of owning
        </h3><ul><li>It\u2019s a big financial commitment \u2013 you need to be sure
        you can afford what you\u2019re taking on. See the later section \u2018Can
        you afford to buy?\u2019 </li></ul><ul><li>You also need to be sure you can
        afford maintenance costs such as replacing a boiler if it packs up or fixing
        a leaky roof. If you stretch yourself too much when you buy you may resent
        not having money for meals out, holidays and entertainment. </li></ul><ul><li>You
        have less flexibility than when renting. For example, if you want to move
        for work or personal reasons selling up and moving on is far more expensive
        if you own as you\u2019ll have all of the associated estate agency and legal
        fees. Also bear in mind that it may not always be easy to sell your home \u2013
        you\u2019ll be dependent on what\u2019s happening in the market. </li></ul><ul><li>If
        you\u2019re living with someone else and split up, the process of sorting
        out the property will be far more complicated and expensive.</li></ul><h2>Are
        you better off buying or renting? </h2><p>You\u2019re not necessarily going
        to be better off financially buying rather than renting your home. </p><p>If
        the value of your property falls, you may find yourself unable to sell because
        you owe more to your mortgage lender than your home is worth. </p><p>On the
        other hand, if house prices rise, you could make a nice profit that could
        help fund a move to a bigger home or give you a lump sum if you choose to
        downsize later on in life. </p><h2>Can you afford to buy? </h2><p>The first
        step towards buying a property is figuring out whether you can afford to do
        so. There are many costs associated with buying your own home, beyond your
        mortgage repayments, including: </p><ul><li>deposit </li></ul><ul><li>legal
        costs such as solicitor\u2019s fees </li></ul><ul><li>survey cost </li></ul><ul><li>Stamp
        Duty </li></ul><ul><li>removal costs, and </li></ul><ul><li>your monthly bills
        \u2013 such as gas, electricity, home phone, etc.</li></ul><p>Use the links
        below to get a better idea of you likely costs. </p><p>If buying isn\u2019t
        an option for you right now, think about setting up a savings plan to achieve
        your goal in the future. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><a href=\"/en/articles/estimate-your-overall-buying-and-moving-costs\">Estimate

        about Help to Buy? Read our most frequently asked questions about the new
        government schemes.","body":"<p class=\"intro\"><img alt=\"Help to Buy schemes
        - bunch of keysand house keyring\" src=\"/images/help-to-buy-schemes---faqs.jpg\"/>Confused
        about the government''s Help to Buy initiative and how it might affect you?
        We answer some of the most frequently asked questions about the schemes. </p><h2>1.
        Does Help to Buy make it easier for me to buy a property?\u00a0 </h2><p>Yes
        - as long as you have at least a 5% deposit saved and can prove that you can
        afford the mortgage payments. </p><p>You\u2019ll also need to meet the mortgage
        provider\u2019s own lending conditions \u2013 these can vary between provider.
        </p><h2>2. Does Help to Buy cover anywhere outside of England? </h2><p>The
        Help to Buy equity loan scheme is only available in England. The Scottish
        Parliament has recently announced a similar scheme with a property price cap
        of \u00a3400,000. </p><p>The Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme is available
        across the UK and includes Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. </p><h2>3.
        Would I be better using the equity loan or mortgage guarantee? </h2><p>This
        really depends on your needs.\u00a0 </p><p>The equity loan scheme can only
        be used for new build flats and houses, while the mortgage guarantee scheme
        can be used for both new build and pre-owned property. </p><p>Speak with a
        mortgage adviser to help decide which scheme is most suited to you. </p><h2>4.
        I need to sell my home to buy a bigger one - do I qualify? </h2><p>Yes - both
        schemes are available to existing home owners as well as first-time buyers
        as long as the property price is not more that \u00a3600,000 (\u00a3400,000
        for the equity loan scheme in Scotland) </p><h2>5. Will I have difficulty
        selling my home if it was bought through the mortgage guarantee scheme? </h2><p>No
        - buying a home through the mortgage guarantee scheme won\u2019t have an impact
        on its future saleability. </p><p>As there is no shared ownership, the resale
        of the property will be the same as any other property with a standard mortgage.
        </p><h2>6. Will I find it hard to get another mortgage when I move? </h2><p>If
        you borrow up to 95% of a property\u2019s value and it later falls or doesn\u2019t
        increase in value, you may find it difficult to move at a future time. </p><p>You
        can only take out a repayment mortgage through the mortgage guarantee scheme,
        so the amount you borrow gradually reduces over time. This means that by the
        time you come to sell you should have some additional equity in the property,
        even if house prices haven\u2019t gone up. </p><p>You can discuss this - and
        also the possibility of making additional payments to reduce your mortgage
        quicker - with your mortgage lender. </p><h2>7. Will my mortgage payments
        go up after the guarantee scheme ends? </h2><p>No - the mortgage guarantee
        scheme won\u2019t affect your future mortgage rates. </p><p>If you\u2019re
        worried about mortgage payments going up, you can ask if the lender offers
        fixed rates. </p><p>It\u2019s important you know when your mortgage rate is
        due to go up - your mortgage lender or broker has the duty to let you know
        this before you agree to go ahead. Always make sure to discuss your mortgage
        rates with your lender. </p><h2>8. Would I be better off renting, or buying
        through Help to Buy? </h2><p>This depends on your individual circumstances.
        </p><p>The two Help to Buy schemes are designed to help people who have already
        made the decision to buy and who have a deposit of at least 5%. </p><h2>9.
        I need to move this year \u2013 is the guarantee scheme right for me? </h2><p>You
        should let your mortgage lender or broker know of your need to move this year
        as they would be well placed to let you know if this is possible or not. </p><h2>10.
        Do I need to know which lenders are signed up to the mortgage guarantee scheme?
        </h2><p>You can apply for the mortgage guarantee scheme through any participating
        lender. </p><p>You can find more information on lenders taking part and eligibility
        on the <a title=\"Help to Buy website\" target=\"_blank\" data-link-type=\"external\"
        href=\"http://www.helptobuy.org.uk\">Help to Buy website</a>. </p>","categories":["buying-a-home"]}'

        area you choose to live in, but also to your life (and to another person if
        you are buying with a loved one or friend). </p><h3>Benefits of owning your
        home </h3><p>There are many benefits to home ownership. Here are just some
        of them. </p><ul><li>Once you\u2019ve paid off your mortgage, your home will
        be yours and it could be worth far more than you paid for it. </li></ul><ul><li>If
        your home increases in value you can use that equity to help you afford a
        bigger home or to fund a more comfortable retirement if you downsize. </li></ul><ul><li>When
        you retire you won\u2019t necessarily have the income you need to keep on
        paying rent \u2013 if you have paid your mortgage off you\u2019ll be living
        there \u2018rent free\u2019. </li></ul><ul><li>You can spend money improving
        your home and increasing its value, whereas you can\u2019t alter a rented
        home without the landlord\u2019s permission. </li></ul><ul><li>Sometimes it
        can be cheaper to buy than to rent.</li></ul><h3>Potential downsides of owning
        </h3><ul><li>It\u2019s a big financial commitment \u2013 you need to be sure
        you can afford what you\u2019re taking on. See the later section \u2018Can
        you afford to buy?\u2019 </li></ul><ul><li>You also need to be sure you can
        afford maintenance costs such as replacing a boiler if it packs up or fixing
        a leaky roof. If you stretch yourself too much when you buy you may resent
        not having money for meals out, holidays and entertainment. </li></ul><ul><li>You
        have less flexibility than when renting. For example, if you want to move
        for work or personal reasons selling up and moving on is far more expensive
        if you own as you\u2019ll have all of the associated estate agency and legal
        fees. Also bear in mind that it may not always be easy to sell your home \u2013
        you\u2019ll be dependent on what\u2019s happening in the market. </li></ul><ul><li>If
        you\u2019re living with someone else and split up, the process of sorting
        out the property will be far more complicated and expensive.</li></ul><h2>Are
        you better off buying or renting? </h2><p>You\u2019re not necessarily going
        to be better off financially buying rather than renting your home. </p><p>If
        the value of your property falls, you may find yourself unable to sell because
        you owe more to your mortgage lender than your home is worth. </p><p>On the
        other hand, if house prices rise, you could make a nice profit that could
        help fund a move to a bigger home or give you a lump sum if you choose to
        downsize later on in life. </p><h2>Can you afford to buy? </h2><p>The first
        step towards buying a property is figuring out whether you can afford to do
        so. There are many costs associated with buying your own home, beyond your
        mortgage repayments, including: </p><ul><li>deposit </li></ul><ul><li>legal
        costs such as solicitor\u2019s fees </li></ul><ul><li>survey cost </li></ul><ul><li>Stamp
        Duty </li></ul><ul><li>removal costs, and </li></ul><ul><li>your monthly bills
        \u2013 such as gas, electricity, home phone, etc.</li></ul><p>Use the links
        below to get a better idea of you likely costs. </p><p>If buying isn\u2019t
        an option for you right now, think about setting up a savings plan to achieve
        your goal in the future. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><a href=\"/en/articles/estimate-your-overall-buying-and-moving-costs\">Estimate
