  body: "<p class=\"intro\"><img alt=\"Changes to Child Benefit from 2013\" src=\"/images/changes-to-child-benefit-from-2013.jpg\"/>If either you or your partner has an income of more than £50,000 a year then you have to pay back some or all of your Child Benefit in the form of extra Income Tax. Read on to find out more. </p><h2>You and your partner each earn less than £50,000 per year </h2><p>If you and your partner each has an income of less than £50,000 a year, you will receive the full amount of Child Benefit without having to pay any of it back. </p><h2>Either you or your partner earns between £50,000 and £60,000 per year  </h2><p>If either you or your partner has an income of between £50,000 and £60,000 a year each, you have to pay a proportion of your Child Benefit back in extra Income Tax. </p><h3>How does this work? </h3><p>You still get paid the full amount of Child Benefit each month (or each week if you're paid weekly). However, whichever one of you has the higher income has to pay more Income Tax to repay the proportion of Child Benefit you're no longer entitled to. </p><p>You need to fill in a Self Assessment tax return so that HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) can calculate the amount of extra Income Tax you have to pay. </p><h3>How much do you have to pay back? </h3><p>Basically, you pay back 1% of your family's Child Benefit for every extra £100 of income over £50,000. </p><p><strong>For example </strong></p><p>Katya and Leroy have a baby. Katya is staying at home to look after the baby. Leroy earns £51,000 a year. Leroy has to pay extra tax to repay some of their Child Benefit. His income is 10 x £100 over the limit, so the extra tax is 10% of their Child Benefit of £20.30 per week. He pays extra tax of £105 a year. </p><div class=\"add-action\"><span class=\"action-text\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-calculator\">Get an estimate of how much tax you’d have to pay because of your Child Benefit on the Gov.uk website</a></span> <a href=\"#\" class=\"action-email\" data-action-id=\"1481\" data-article-id=\"\" data-article-type=\"\" id=\"email_me_1481\" tabindex=\"0\">Email this <span class=\"visuallyhidden\">page</span></a><form action=\"/en/action_items/external?external_action_id=1481\" class=\"action-form\" data-remote=\"true\" data-resource-path=\"/en/action_items/external?external_action_id=1481\" method=\"post\" name=\"1481\"><div><input class=\"action-submit\" data-action-event=\"add\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Add to my to do list\" /><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"rNLoxfl7rwP9ks7NfO/WluXoPkyfG+ajAMBpHsFDfpw=\" /></div></form> </div><h2>Either you or your partner earns more than £60,000 per year  </h2><p>If either you or your partner has an income of more than £60,000 a year, you have to repay all of your Child Benefit as Income Tax. </p><h3>How does this work?  </h3><p>You still get paid the full amount of Child Benefit each month (or each week if you're paid weekly).
