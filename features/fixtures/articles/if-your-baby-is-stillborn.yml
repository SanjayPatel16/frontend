  description: "If you’re faced with the tragedy of a stillbirth, money matters won’t seem important, but some financial help is available"
  body: "<p class=\"intro\">When you go through the tragedy of a stillbirth – everything else takes a back seat. But when you’re ready, there are some practicalities to deal with. </p><p>The information below also applies if you have had a termination after 24 completed weeks due to a foetal abnormality. </p><h2>Are you entitled to maternity benefits and entitlements? </h2><p>Generally speaking, if your baby was stillborn any time after 24 completed weeks of pregnancy, you are entitled to financial support. </p><h2>What do you need to do? </h2><p>You will need to tell a few key people what’s happened. The best way to do this is usually to phone, or perhaps to email. If you can’t phone yourself, you may be able to get a relative or close friend to make some of the calls for you. </p><h3>Contact your employer </h3><p>You’re entitled to a total of 52 weeks leave. You’ll get maternity pay while you’re off work for a maximum of 39 weeks (providing you’ve been working for long enough), in the form of Statutory Maternity Pay or your employer’s own scheme. You must claim within 28 days of the death. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><span class=\"action-text\">Speak to your employer about maternity pay and leave</span> <a href=\"#\" class=\"action-email\" data-action-id=\"483\" data-article-id=\"\" data-article-type=\"\" id=\"email_me_483\" tabindex=\"0\">Email this <span class=\"visuallyhidden\">page</span></a><form action=\"/en/action_items/external?external_action_id=483\" class=\"action-form\" data-remote=\"true\" data-resource-path=\"/en/action_items/external?external_action_id=483\" method=\"post\" name=\"483\"><div><input class=\"action-submit\" data-action-event=\"add\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Add to my to do list\" /><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"rNLoxfl7rwP9ks7NfO/WluXoPkyfG+ajAMBpHsFDfpw=\" /></div></form> </div></p><h3>Speak to your doctor or midwife </h3><p>They will help you claim free prescriptions and NHS dental treatment for 12 months. Ask them for form FW8, which you fill in and they sign, then you’ll receive your Maternity Exemption certificate in the post. </p><p>They will also help you with the <a target=\"_blank\" data-link-type=\"external\" href=\"http://www.healthystart.nhs.uk/\">Healthy Start programme</a> if you've been claiming vouchers. You won’t get any more vouchers but you can use any you’ve already received. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><span class=\"action-text\">Healthy Start Helpline – 0845 607 6823</span> <a href=\"#\" class=\"action-email\" data-action-id=\"472\" data-article-id=\"\" data-article-type=\"\" id=\"email_me_472\" tabindex=\"0\">Email this <span class=\"visuallyhidden\">page</span></a><form action=\"/en/action_items/external?external_action_id=472\" class=\"action-form\" data-remote=\"true\" data-resource-path=\"/en/action_items/external?external_action_id=472\" method=\"post\" name=\"472\"><div><input class=\"action-submit\" data-action-event=\"add\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Add to my to do list\" /><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"rNLoxfl7rwP9ks7NfO/WluXoPkyfG+ajAMBpHsFDfpw=\" /></div></form> </div></p><h3>Contact Jobcentre Plus or the Jobs and Benefits Office </h3><p>If you’re not eligible for Statutory Maternity Pay, your Jobcentre Plus or Jobs and Benefits Office can help you make a claim for Maternity Allowance or Employment and Support Allowance. Ask about the Sure Start Maternity Grant too – if you’re on a low income, you should still be eligible. </p><h2>Registering your baby </h2><p>Your baby’s birth must be registered in England and Wales within 42 days, and in Scotland within 21 days. In most places you will need to go to your local register office. In a few places you can register at the hospital. The hospital staff will tell you what you need to do and where to go.  </p><h3>Registering your baby in Northern Ireland </h3><p>Registration is not compulsory in Northern Ireland, but you can register a stillbirth within three months if you choose to. You will then get a formal certificate from the registrar. </p><h2>Making funeral arrangements </h2><p>A baby who is stillborn after 24 weeks of pregnancy must by law be formally buried or cremated. </p><p>Many hospitals will offer to arrange a funeral for you free of charge or you can make your own arrangements. Most funeral directors offer a simple funeral service for babies free of charge. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><span class=\"action-text\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.uk-sands.org/Support/Deciding-about-a-funeral.html\">More about funerals on the Sands website </a></span> <a href=\"#\" class=\"action-email\" data-action-id=\"484\" data-article-id=\"\" data-article-type=\"\" id=\"email_me_484\" tabindex=\"0\">Email this <span class=\"visuallyhidden\">page</span></a><form action=\"/en/action_items/external?external_action_id=484\" class=\"action-form\" data-remote=\"true\" data-resource-path=\"/en/action_items/external?external_action_id=484\" method=\"post\" name=\"484\"><div><input class=\"action-submit\" data-action-event=\"add\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Add to my to do list\" /><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"rNLoxfl7rwP9ks7NfO/WluXoPkyfG+ajAMBpHsFDfpw=\" /></div></form> </div></p><p>If you're on a low income, the Social Fund may be able to help with any funeral expenses. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><span class=\"action-text\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/funeral-payments\">Find out more about Funeral Payments from the Social Fund on the Gov.uk website</a></span> <a href=\"#\" class=\"action-email\" data-action-id=\"485\" data-article-id=\"\" data-article-type=\"\" id=\"email_me_485\" tabindex=\"0\">Email this <span class=\"visuallyhidden\">page</span></a><form action=\"/en/action_items/external?external_action_id=485\" class=\"action-form\" data-remote=\"true\" data-resource-path=\"/en/action_items/external?external_action_id=485\" method=\"post\" name=\"485\"><div><input class=\"action-submit\" data-action-event=\"add\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Add to my to do list\" /><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"rNLoxfl7rwP9ks7NfO/WluXoPkyfG+ajAMBpHsFDfpw=\" /></div></form> </div></p><h2>More information </h2><p>It’s easy to be overwhelmed by some of the things you need to do and the decisions you need to make.
