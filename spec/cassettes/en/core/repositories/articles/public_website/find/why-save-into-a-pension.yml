        are an efficient way to save for retirement. Contributions are topped up by
        the taxman and often by employers","body":"<p class=\"intro\"><img src=\"/images/why-save-into-a-pension.jpg\"/>Pensions
        might seem complicated but the basic idea is a simple one. It\u2019s worth
        understanding their benefits, because your State Pension \u2013 while providing
        a foundation \u2013 may not be enough to live on. You need to save more.\u00a0
        </p><h2>The importance of retirement savings </h2><div class=\"callout\"><h3>DID
        YOU KNOW? </h3><p>The maximum basic State Pension is far below what most people
        say they hope to retire on. </p></div><p>More than half of people in the UK
        either aren\u2019t saving at all for their retirement or they aren\u2019t
        saving nearly enough to give them the standard of living they hope for when
        they retire. </p><p>If you fall into this category, you have three choices
        really. You can adjust downwards your expectations of what you\u2019ll be
        able to afford in retirement. Or you can start saving more. Or you can retire
        later. </p><p>Don\u2019t rely on the State Pension to keep you going in retirement.
        The maximum basic State Pension of \u00a3113.10 (tax year 2014-15) a week
        is far below what most people say they hope to retire on. </p><h2>The advantages
        of saving into a pension </h2><p>Once you\u2019ve made the decision to start
        saving for retirement, you need to choose how to do so. Pensions have a number
        of important advantages that will make your savings grow more rapidly than
        might otherwise be the case. </p><p>A pension is basically a long-term savings
        plan with tax relief - your regular contributions are invested so that they
        grow throughout your career and then provide you with an income in retirement.
        Generally you can access the money in your pension pot from the age of 55.
        </p><h3>How tax relief tops up your pension pot </h3><p>Once your income is
        over a certain level, the government takes tax from your earnings. You can
        see this on your payslip. If you put money into a personal pension scheme,
        it qualifies for tax relief. This means that as well as the money you\u2019re
        putting in, some of your money that would have gone to the government as tax
        now goes into your pension pot instead. The government will still put tax
        relief into your pension pot, even if your income is too low to pay tax.\u00a0
        </p><h3>Top-ups from employers </h3><p>The government has introduced a law
        designed to help people save more for their retirement. It means that employers
        must start to enrol their workers into a workplace pension scheme if they
        are not already in one. It\u2019s called \u2018automatic enrolment\u2019 and
        is gradually being made compulsory for all employers. \u00a0 </p><p>If your
        work gives you access to a pension that your employer will pay into, then
        unless you really can\u2019t afford to contribute or your priority is dealing
        with unmanageable debt, staying out is like turning down the offer of a pay
        rise. </p><p>Of course, if your employer will contribute to your pension regardless
        of whether you pay into it, then you should join the scheme whatever your
        financial circumstances. </p><ul><li><a title=\"Automatic enrolment\" href=\"/en/articles/automatic-enrolment-into-a-workplace-pension\">Find
        out more in our guide Automatic enrolment - an introduction</a></li></ul><h3>A
        tax-free lump sum when you retire </h3><p>When you retire, you can take up
        to a quarter of your pension pot as a tax-free lump sum. The rest of your
        savings must be used to provide an income, which is taxable. However, from
        April 2015 you will be able to use your pension pot in any way you choose
        from age 55. </p><ul><li><a title=\"New rules about pensions from 27 March
