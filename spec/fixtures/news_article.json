Flood insurance is usually included in standard <a title=\"Home insurance\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/buildings-insurance-what-does-a-good-policy-look-like\">home insurance policies</a>, but it’s best to check. If your policy doesn’t include it ask your insurer how much an upgrade will cost. </p><h2>Know your policy limitations </h2><p>Take time to read through your insurance policy so you know what to expect if you need to make a claim. Not all policies will replace damaged items on a new-for-old basis; some pay you the value of your damaged goods taking into account their age or condition at the time of the flood, meaning you would have to pay extra to replace them. </p><h2>Preventative measures </h2><p>If severe weather is forecast <a title=\"Flood insurance\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/flood-insurance-getting-the-right-cover\">take steps to avoid unnecessary damage</a> to your home and other property. </p><p>You can take steps to prevent storm or flood damage by ensuring your property is well maintained. Clear gutters of leaves and other debris, and fix damaged roofs and down-pipes if it is safe to do so. </p><p>Temporary remedies, such as stacking sand bags or plastic sacks filled with earth outside of your front and back doors can also help stop water getting into your home.  Longer term measures could be worth investing in if you live in an area that is prone to flooding, such as air brick covers and raised power points. </p><p>If you live on low-lying land, near a stream or other watercourse consider parking your car on higher ground. </p><p>You may well be covered under your insurance, but limiting your exposure to risk hopefully means avoiding unnecessary hassle. </p><h2>Take action on flood prevention </h2><p>There are other things you can do to reduce your flood risk. These include: </p><ul><li>signing up for flood warnings</li><li>joining a flood action group</li><li>lobbying for improvements to flood defences locally (working with your local authority and get involved in public consultations)</li></ul><h2>Keep a record of any damage </h2><p>If the worst happens, keep a detailed account of any damage you would want to make an <a title=\"Making an insurance claim\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/making-an-insurance-claim\">insurance claim</a> on. Take photos of any damage and contact your insurer before clearing up, as they may want to send round a claims assessor. You may need to throw away damaged perishables, but keep wrappers and receipts where possible as prove of your loss. </p><h2>Specialist insurers </h2><p>If you have suffered flood damage you could find it hard to get affordable home insurance when your policy term ends, as general insurers may consider your home to be in a high risk category. In this case you should <a title=\"insurance brokers\" href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/when-to-use-an-insurance-broker\">consider using a specialist</a> to find you the right insurance. </p><p>The <a title=\"BIBA\" data-link-type=\"external\" href=\"http://www.biba.org.uk/\">British Insurance Brokers’ Association</a> (0870 950 1790) should be able to help you find affordable cover so that you are protected in the event of any subsequent flooding. </p><h2>Check your risk </h2><p>Government websites offer advice on the types of risk properties in your area are prone to and what you can do to reduce your risk. </p><p>If you live in England or Wales look at the <a title=\"Flood map\" data-link-type=\"external\" href=\"http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiybyController?x=357683.0&amp;y=355134.0&amp;scale=1&amp;layerGroups=default&amp;ep=map&amp;textonly=off&amp;lang=_e&amp;topic=floodmap\">flood map on the Environment Agency website</a>. </p><p>If you live in Scotland you can find relevant information on the <a title=\"Scottish flood maps\" data-link-type=\"external\" href=\"http://www.sepa.org.uk/flooding/flood_extent_maps.aspx\">Scottish Environmental Protection Agency website</a>. </p><p><a title=\"Northern Ireland flood map information\" data-link-type=\"external\" href=\"http://www.dardni.gov.uk/index/rivers/strategic-flood-map-ni.htm\">The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development website</a> has flood-related information for people in Northern Ireland. </p><p><div class=\"add-action\"><a href=\"/en/articles/flood-insurance-getting-the-right-cover\">For more information read our guide Flood insurance – getting the right cover</a> <a href=\"#\" class=\"action-email\" data-action-id=\"\" data-article-id=\"flood-insurance-getting-the-right-cover\" data-article-type=\"guide\" id=\"email_me_flood-insurance-getting-the-right-cover\" tabindex=\"0\">Email this <span class=\"visuallyhidden\">page</span></a><form action=\"/en/action_items/internal?article_id=flood-insurance-getting-the-right-cover&amp;article_type=guide\" class=\"action-form\" data-remote=\"true\" data-resource-path=\"/en/action_items/internal?article_id=flood-insurance-getting-the-right-cover&amp;article_type=guide\" method=\"post\" name=\"guide_flood-insurance-getting-the-right-cover\"><div><input class=\"action-submit\" data-action-event=\"add\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Add to my to do list\" /><input name=\"authenticity_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"BAt8O0ax93c6XDI6209wV/jBzyf6SujU6lWSj5+RUhk=\" /></div></form> </div></p><h2>Follow us </h2><p>For the latest on floods visit us on <a title=\"Facebook\" data-link-type=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MoneyAdviceService\">Facebook </a>and <a title=\"Twitter\" data-link-type=\"external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/YourMoneyAdvice/\">Twitter</a>. </p><p><em>Photo: PA</em>. </p>"
