      content:
        intro: A lifetime annuity provides you with a regular retirement income for life – with the guarantee that the money won’t run out before you die.

          Other lifetime annuities include <a href="/en/articles/investment-linked-annuities">investment linked</a> or flexible annuities – which have an income based on the investments chosen. They carry more risk than basic lifetime annuities in return for a potentially higher income.  It’s important you choose the type and features best suited to your personal circumstances, your life expectancy and your attitude to risk.
